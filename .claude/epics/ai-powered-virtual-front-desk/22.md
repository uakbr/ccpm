# Design decision tree JSON schema

## Description
Design and implement a comprehensive JSON schema for representing decision trees that will drive the virtual front desk conversation flow. The schema must support complex branching logic, data collection, and integration with appointment scheduling systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JSON schema definition for decision tree structure
- [ ] Node types defined (prompt, collect, condition, action, transfer)
- [ ] Branching logic representation (conditions, rules)
- [ ] Data slot definitions and validation rules
- [ ] Integration points with external systems
- [ ] Schema versioning and backward compatibility
- [ ] Validation tools for schema compliance
- [ ] Documentation and examples for schema usage

## Technical Details
- **Schema Format**: JSON Schema specification v7 or later
- **Node Types**: Prompt, input collection, conditional logic, actions
- **Branching**: Rule-based conditions, regex matching, value comparisons
- **Data Slots**: Typed data collection (string, number, date, phone)
- **Actions**: API calls, transfers, scheduling operations
- **Versioning**: Schema migration and compatibility handling

## Dependencies
- None (foundational design task)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Schema design and specification: 4-6 hours
- Node type definitions: 3-4 hours
- Validation and tooling: 2-3 hours
- Documentation and examples: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- JSON schema accurately represents decision tree requirements
- All necessary node types and branching logic are supported
- Data collection and validation capabilities are comprehensive
- Schema validation tools prevent invalid tree definitions
- Documentation provides clear guidance for tree creation
- Examples demonstrate common use cases and patterns

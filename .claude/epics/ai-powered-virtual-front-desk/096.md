# Implement SMS delivery logic

## Description
Create robust SMS delivery system that handles message sending, delivery confirmation, failure handling, and optimization for high-volume healthcare communications.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reliable message delivery with confirmation tracking
- [ ] Batch processing for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Delivery timing optimization and scheduling
- [ ] Carrier-specific optimization and routing
- [ ] Message queuing and prioritization
- [ ] Delivery analytics and reporting

## Technical Details
- Message delivery architecture:
  - Asynchronous message processing with queue-based delivery
  - Message priority queuing (urgent, normal, low priority)
  - Batch processing optimization for cost and performance
  - Delivery scheduling with time zone awareness
- Delivery confirmation and tracking:
  - Real-time delivery status monitoring via webhooks
  - Delivery receipt processing and status updates
  - Failed delivery detection and categorization
  - Message expiration handling for time-sensitive content
- Carrier optimization and routing:
  - Intelligent carrier selection for optimal delivery
  - Carrier-specific message formatting and optimization
  - International SMS routing with cost optimization
  - Carrier failover for improved delivery rates
- Message queuing and processing:
  - Redis-based message queue with persistence
  - Dead letter queue for failed messages
  - Message deduplication to prevent duplicates
  - Queue monitoring and backlog management
- Delivery timing optimization:
  - Business hours delivery for non-urgent messages
  - Time zone-aware scheduling for multi-region practices
  - Optimal delivery time prediction based on recipient behavior
  - Rate limiting to comply with carrier restrictions
- Performance monitoring and analytics:
  - Delivery rate tracking by carrier and region
  - Message cost analysis and optimization
  - Delivery time analytics and performance tuning
  - Error rate monitoring and alerting

## Dependencies
- Twilio Messaging service (094)
- SMS template system (095)
- Message queue infrastructure (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- Analytics and monitoring platform

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Delivery architecture and queuing: 6-8 hours
- Confirmation tracking and status handling: 4-6 hours
- Carrier optimization and routing: 3-4 hours
- Analytics and monitoring: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- SMS delivery system handles high-volume messaging reliably
- Delivery confirmation tracking provides real-time status updates
- Message queuing and prioritization optimize delivery performance
- Carrier optimization improves delivery rates and reduces costs
- Delivery timing respects recipient preferences and business rules
- Analytics provide actionable insights for optimization

# Implement decision tree testing framework

## Description
Create a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed for decision trees, enabling automated testing of conversation flows, user scenarios, and edge cases. This framework will ensure decision trees work correctly before deployment and provide regression testing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated test execution for decision trees
- [ ] Conversation flow simulation with mock inputs
- [ ] Test case definition and management system
- [ ] Coverage analysis for tree nodes and branches
- [ ] Performance testing for tree execution
- [ ] Integration with existing testing infrastructure
- [ ] Regression test suite for tree modifications
- [ ] Reporting and visualization of test results

## Technical Details
- **Simulation**: Mock user inputs, external API responses
- **Test Cases**: Scenarios covering all conversation paths
- **Coverage**: Node, branch, and condition coverage analysis
- **Performance**: Execution time, memory usage metrics
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
- **Reporting**: Detailed test results and coverage reports

## Dependencies
- Task 008 (Testing frameworks for integration)
- Task 023 (State machine for test execution)
- Task 027 (Tree validator for test validation)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: L (16-24 hours)
- Testing framework development: 6-8 hours
- Simulation and mock systems: 4-6 hours
- Coverage analysis implementation: 3-4 hours
- Integration and reporting: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Testing framework executes automated tests for decision trees
- Conversation flows are simulated with realistic inputs
- Coverage analysis identifies untested tree branches
- Performance testing validates tree execution efficiency
- Integration with CI/CD ensures automated testing
- Regression testing catches tree modification issues

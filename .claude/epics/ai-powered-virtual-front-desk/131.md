## Description
Implement chaos engineering tests to validate system resilience by intentionally introducing failures and testing system recovery capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement service failure simulation tests
- [ ] Create network partition and latency injection tests
- [ ] Test database failover and recovery scenarios
- [ ] Validate circuit breaker and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Create disaster recovery simulation tests

## Technical Details
- Use Chaos Monkey or similar tools for failure injection
- Implement gradual failure introduction in non-production environments
- Create monitoring to track system behavior during chaos tests
- Test auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities
- Document system behavior and recovery patterns

## Dependencies
- Load testing framework must be operational
- System monitoring and alerting must be configured

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Chaos engineering tests operational in staging environment
- System resilience validated against common failure scenarios
- Recovery mechanisms tested and documented
- Chaos test execution automated and scheduled
- System weaknesses identified and addressed

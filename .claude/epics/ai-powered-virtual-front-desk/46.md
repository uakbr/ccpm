# Create patient identity confirmation

## Description
Develop a user-friendly identity confirmation process that allows patients to verify their identity through voice interaction while ensuring security and compliance requirements are met.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive identity confirmation workflow
- [ ] Multiple confirmation methods based on available information
- [ ] Clear voice prompts and confirmation messages
- [ ] Graceful handling of confirmation failures
- [ ] Integration with appointment booking flow

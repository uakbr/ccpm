# Create patient lookup optimization

## Description
Optimize patient lookup performance through advanced indexing strategies, query optimization, and intelligent search algorithms to provide sub-second response times for voice interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sub-second response time for most patient lookups
- [ ] Optimized database indexes for common search patterns
- [ ] Query optimization and execution plan analysis
- [ ] Predictive search and autocomplete capabilities
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Scalability testing for large patient databases

## Technical Details
- Implement database optimization:
  - Composite indexes for multi-field searches
  - Partial indexes for common query patterns
  - Index maintenance and statistics updates
  - Query execution plan optimization
- Develop intelligent search algorithms:
  - Predictive search based on partial input
  - Search suggestion and autocomplete
  - Relevance scoring and result ranking
  - Search pattern learning and optimization
- Create performance monitoring:
  - Query performance tracking
  - Slow query identification and optimization
  - Database performance metrics
  - Search pattern analysis
- Implement scalability features:
  - Connection pooling optimization
  - Read replica utilization
  - Database sharding strategies
  - Load balancing for search operations

## Dependencies
- Patient search functionality (040)
- Patient record caching (047)
- Database performance monitoring tools
- Load testing infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Database optimization: 6-8 hours
- Search algorithm enhancement: 6-8 hours
- Performance monitoring: 2-4 hours
- Scalability testing: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient lookups consistently respond in under 500ms
- Database indexes are optimized for common search patterns
- Performance monitoring identifies and alerts on degradation
- System scales effectively with increasing patient database size
- Search algorithms provide relevant and fast results
- Comprehensive performance testing validates optimization

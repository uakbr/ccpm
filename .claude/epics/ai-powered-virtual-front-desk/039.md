# Create patient data models

## Description
Design and implement comprehensive data models for patient information storage, retrieval, and management within the virtual front desk system, ensuring HIPAA compliance and data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patient entity model with all required demographic fields
- [ ] Contact information model with multiple contact methods
- [ ] Insurance information model with validation rules
- [ ] Emergency contact model with relationship tracking
- [ ] Patient preferences model for communication and scheduling
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant data structure with proper access controls

## Technical Details
- Design core patient entity:
  - Personal identifiers (name, DOB, SSN, MRN)
  - Demographic information (address, phone, email)
  - Insurance details (primary/secondary, policy numbers, group IDs)
  - Emergency contacts with relationships
  - Communication preferences (phone, email, text, language)
- Implement data validation:
  - Required field validation
  - Format validation (phone numbers, emails, dates)
  - Business rule validation (age consistency, insurance validity)
- Create data relationships:
  - Patient-to-appointment associations
  - Patient-to-provider relationships
  - Historical data linking
- Ensure HIPAA compliance:
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit
  - Access logging and audit trails
  - Data retention and purging policies

## Dependencies
- Database infrastructure
- Data encryption and security frameworks
- HIPAA compliance requirements
- Healthcare data standards (HL7, FHIR)

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Data model design: 6-8 hours
- Implementation and validation: 6-8 hours
- Security and compliance: 4-6 hours
- Testing and documentation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient data models are implemented with full CRUD operations
- All required fields and relationships are properly defined
- Data validation rules prevent invalid data entry
- HIPAA compliance requirements are met
- Models support efficient querying and indexing
- Comprehensive documentation is available

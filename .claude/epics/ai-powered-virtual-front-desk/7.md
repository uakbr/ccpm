# Establish secure credential management

## Description
Implement a secure credential management system for storing and accessing sensitive information including API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. This system must meet HIPAA requirements for data protection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Secret management service configured (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- [ ] All API credentials migrated to secure storage
- [ ] Environment-specific credential isolation implemented
- [ ] Credential rotation policies established
- [ ] Access controls and audit logging configured
- [ ] Local development credential management solution
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures for credentials

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with least privilege
- **Rotation**: Automated rotation for supported services
- **Audit**: Complete audit trail of credential access
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with application code

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Twilio credentials to be managed)
- Task 002 (NexHealth API credentials to be managed)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Secret service setup: 3-4 hours
- Credential migration: 2-3 hours
- Access control configuration: 3-4 hours
- Integration and testing: 4-5 hours

## Definition of Done
- All credentials are stored securely and not in code
- Applications can retrieve credentials programmatically
- Access is properly controlled and logged
- Credential rotation is functional where supported
- Local development has secure credential access
- Security review confirms HIPAA compliance

## Description
Implement comprehensive access control mechanisms including role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication, and least privilege principles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement role-based access control system
- [ ] Configure multi-factor authentication for all users
- [ ] Establish least privilege access principles
- [ ] Create access review and recertification processes
- [ ] Implement session management and timeout controls

## Technical Details
- Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Implement RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- Configure MFA using TOTP, SMS, or hardware tokens
- Set up automated access reviews and provisioning
- Implement just-in-time access for administrative functions

## Dependencies

- User management system required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- RBAC system operational with defined roles and permissions
- MFA enforced for all user accounts
- Access controls tested and validated
- Access review processes established and documented
- Session management controls implemented and tested

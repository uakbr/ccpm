# Create new patient registration flow

## Description
Develop a conversational flow for registering new patients through voice interaction, collecting all required information while maintaining a natural, user-friendly experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Step-by-step information collection workflow
- [ ] Voice-guided prompts for each required field
- [ ] Real-time validation and error correction
- [ ] Information confirmation and review process
- [ ] Integration with duplicate patient detection
- [ ] Partial registration saving and resumption capability

## Technical Details
- Design registration workflow:
  - Progressive information collection (basic info first)
  - Contextual prompts for each field
  - Conditional logic for optional information
  - Confirmation and review steps
- Implement voice interaction handling:
  - Natural language prompts for data collection
  - Format guidance for complex fields (dates, phone numbers)
  - Spelling confirmation for names and addresses
  - Retry mechanisms for unclear responses
- Create validation and error handling:
  - Real-time field validation during collection
  - User-friendly error messages and correction prompts
  - Duplicate detection before final registration
  - Data completeness checks
- Develop session management:
  - Progress tracking through registration steps
  - Ability to pause and resume registration
  - Timeout handling with data preservation

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient search functionality (040)
- Voice interaction components
- Form validation frameworks

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Workflow design and implementation: 10-12 hours
- Voice interaction integration: 8-10 hours
- Validation and error handling: 4-6 hours
- Session management: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- New patient registration completes successfully via voice interaction
- All required information is collected with proper validation
- User experience is natural and efficient
- Duplicate patients are detected and handled appropriately
- Registration can be paused and resumed as needed
- Comprehensive error handling provides helpful guidance

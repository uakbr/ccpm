# Initialize Git repository and CI/CD pipeline

## Description
Set up version control and continuous integration/deployment pipeline for the virtual front desk project. This includes repository structure, branching strategy, automated testing, and deployment workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Git repository initialized with appropriate structure
- [ ] Branching strategy defined (main, develop, feature branches)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured (GitHub Actions or similar)
- [ ] Automated testing workflow set up
- [ ] Code quality checks integrated (linting, security scanning)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline for staging and production environments
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: GitHub with GitHub Actions
- **Branching**: GitFlow or simplified feature branch workflow
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Quality Gates**: Code coverage, security scans, dependency checks
- **Deployments**: Blue-green or rolling deployments
- **Environments**: Development, staging, production

## Dependencies
- None (foundational infrastructure task)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Repository setup and structure: 2-3 hours
- CI/CD pipeline configuration: 4-6 hours
- Quality gate setup: 2-4 hours
- Documentation and testing: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Git repository is properly structured and accessible
- CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on commits
- Automated tests execute and pass
- Code quality checks are enforced
- Deployment pipeline deploys to staging environment
- Documentation covers development and deployment processes

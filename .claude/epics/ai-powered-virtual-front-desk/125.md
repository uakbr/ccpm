## Description
Implement automated security penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities, validate security controls, and ensure system resilience against common attack vectors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Create penetration test scenarios for common attack vectors
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization bypass attempts
- [ ] Validate input validation and injection attack prevention
- [ ] Implement infrastructure and network security testing

## Technical Details
- Use OWASP ZAP or similar tools for automated security scanning
- Create custom test scenarios for healthcare-specific threats
- Test OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Implement network penetration testing for infrastructure
- Set up automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies
- Security testing suite must be operational
- Staging environment with security controls enabled

## Effort Estimate
L (16-24 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Automated penetration testing operational in CI/CD
- Security test scenarios cover all critical attack vectors
- Vulnerability findings tracked and remediated
- Penetration test reports generated automatically
- Security test results prevent deployment of vulnerable code

# Create appointment modification flow

## Description
Build the core workflow for modifying appointments during rescheduling, including slot selection, conflict detection, and temporary reservation management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive slot selection with availability checking
- [ ] Temporary slot reservation during selection process
- [ ] Conflict detection and resolution options
- [ ] Appointment modification transaction management
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed modifications
- [ ] Real-time availability updates

## Technical Details
- Implement modification workflow orchestration:
  - State machine for tracking modification progress
  - Multi-step wizard for guided slot selection
  - Real-time availability checking with provider calendars
  - Temporary slot holding with configurable timeout
- Conflict detection and resolution:
  - Double-booking prevention with pessimistic locking
  - Provider schedule conflict identification
  - Patient schedule conflict checking (if applicable)
  - Alternative slot suggestion engine
- Transaction management:
  - Database transaction boundaries for data consistency
  - Compensation patterns for distributed operations
  - Atomic updates across multiple systems
  - Rollback mechanisms for partial failures
- User experience optimization:
  - Progressive disclosure of available time slots
  - Visual calendar interface for slot selection
  - Instant feedback on slot availability
  - Clear indication of modification progress
- Integration points:
  - Provider calendar system synchronization
  - Insurance authorization system updates
  - Notification system integration
  - Audit logging for all modification steps

## Dependencies
- Rescheduling data models (072)
- Appointment retrieval logic (073)
- Provider calendar integration
- Transaction management framework

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Workflow orchestration: 8-10 hours
- Conflict detection logic: 6-8 hours
- Transaction management: 4-6 hours
- User interface integration: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- Complete modification workflow implemented and tested
- Conflict detection prevents double-bookings
- Transaction integrity maintained across all operations
- User interface provides smooth modification experience
- Integration with external systems functional
- Performance meets scalability requirements

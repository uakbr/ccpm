## Description
Implement blue-green deployment strategy to enable zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capabilities and production traffic switching.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up dual production environments (blue and green)
- [ ] Implement load balancer configuration for traffic switching
- [ ] Create deployment orchestration for environment switching
- [ ] Implement health checks and validation before traffic switch
- [ ] Create monitoring and rollback procedures for blue-green deployments

## Technical Details
- Configure load balancer (ALB, NGINX, or cloud-native) for traffic routing
- Implement database synchronization between environments
- Set up automated testing in standby environment before switch
- Create traffic splitting capabilities for gradual rollout
- Implement monitoring for both environments during deployments

## Dependencies
- Rollback procedures must be established
- Load balancer and network infrastructure required

## Effort Estimate
L (16-24 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Blue-green deployment infrastructure operational
- Traffic switching validated and tested
- Health checks prevent switching to unhealthy environment
- Rollback capabilities tested and functional
- Blue-green deployment procedures documented

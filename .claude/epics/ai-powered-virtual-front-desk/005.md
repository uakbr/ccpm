# Configure monitoring infrastructure

## Description
Set up comprehensive monitoring and observability infrastructure for the virtual front desk system. This includes application performance monitoring, logging aggregation, alerting, and health checks to ensure reliable operation in production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM) configured
- [ ] Centralized logging system set up
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented
- [ ] Alerting rules configured for critical failures
- [ ] Dashboard created for key metrics monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and reporting system configured
- [ ] Uptime monitoring for external dependencies
- [ ] Log retention and rotation policies established

## Technical Details
- **APM**: New Relic, DataDog, or similar
- **Logging**: ELK Stack, CloudWatch, or structured logging
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Slack integrations
- **Metrics**: Response times, error rates, call volumes
- **Health Checks**: /health endpoint with dependency checks
- **Dashboards**: Real-time operational visibility

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (CI/CD pipeline for deployment integration)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Monitoring tool setup: 3-4 hours
- Logging configuration: 3-4 hours
- Dashboard and alert creation: 3-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Monitoring infrastructure is operational across all environments
- Key metrics are being collected and displayed
- Alerts fire correctly for simulated failures
- Logs are centralized and searchable
- Health checks provide accurate system status
- Documentation covers monitoring procedures and runbooks

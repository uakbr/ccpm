# Implement reschedule rollback mechanism

## Description
Create robust rollback system to undo reschedule operations when errors occur, system failures happen, or manual intervention is required to restore original appointment state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic rollback for system failures
- [ ] Manual rollback capability for authorized users
- [ ] Complete state restoration including external systems
- [ ] Rollback notification to affected parties
- [ ] Rollback audit trail and logging
- [ ] Rollback time limits and business rules

## Technical Details
- Automatic rollback triggers:
  - External system integration failures
  - Payment processing failures
  - Insurance authorization failures
  - Critical validation errors discovered post-reschedule
- State restoration mechanisms:
  - Snapshot capture before reschedule operations
  - Transactional rollback across multiple systems
  - Compensation pattern implementation for distributed operations
  - Time-ordered operation replay capability
- Manual rollback framework:
  - Administrative interface for rollback initiation
  - Role-based access control for rollback permissions
  - Approval workflow for high-impact rollbacks
  - Rollback impact assessment and preview
- External system coordination:
  - Provider calendar rollback synchronization
  - EHR system state restoration
  - Payment and billing reversal coordination
  - Resource allocation restoration (rooms, equipment)
- Notification and communication:
  - Automated rollback notification to all affected parties
  - Rollback reason communication and explanation
  - Rescheduling assistance offer for affected patients
  - Staff notification for manual process requirements
- Business rule enforcement:
  - Time limits for rollback eligibility
  - Rollback frequency limits per appointment
  - Provider approval requirements for certain rollbacks
  - Patient consent requirements for rollback communications

## Dependencies
- Appointment update API integration (076)
- Appointment history tracking (079)
- Transaction management framework
- Administrative workflow system

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Rollback mechanism implementation: 8-10 hours
- External system coordination: 6-8 hours
- Manual rollback interface: 4-5 hours
- Notification and business rules: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- Automatic rollback handles system failures reliably
- Manual rollback process functional for authorized users
- Complete state restoration across all systems
- Rollback notifications inform all affected parties
- Audit trail captures all rollback activities
- Business rules enforce appropriate rollback constraints

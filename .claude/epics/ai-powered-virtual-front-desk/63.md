# Create appointment validation rules

## Description
Implement comprehensive appointment validation rules that enforce business logic, healthcare regulations, and scheduling constraints to ensure all booked appointments are valid and appropriate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Healthcare-specific validation rules
- [ ] Business logic constraint enforcement
- [ ] Patient eligibility and qualification checking
- [ ] Provider availability and capability validation
- [ ] Insurance coverage and authorization verification
- [ ] Configurable validation rule management

## Technical Details
- Implement healthcare validation rules:
  - Age-appropriate service validation
  - Medical necessity requirement checking
  - Referral and authorization requirements
  - Appointment sequencing rules (follow-ups after consultations)
- Develop business logic validation:
  - Appointment timing constraints (minimum/maximum intervals)
  - Provider scheduling rules and preferences
  - Resource availability and room assignments
  - Insurance network participation validation
- Create patient eligibility checks:
  - Active patient status verification
  - Insurance coverage validation
  - Outstanding balance and payment requirements
  - Special needs and accommodation requirements
- Implement configurable rule engine:
  - Rule definition and modification interface
  - Priority-based rule evaluation
  - Exception handling and override capabilities
  - Rule performance monitoring and optimization

## Dependencies
- Appointment data models (054)
- Appointment type mapping (056)
- Insurance verification systems
- Healthcare regulation databases

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Healthcare validation rules: 6-8 hours
- Business logic implementation: 6-8 hours
- Configurable rule engine: 4-6 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- All appointment bookings pass comprehensive validation checks
- Healthcare regulations and business rules are properly enforced
- Validation rules are configurable and maintainable
- Invalid appointments are prevented with clear error messaging
- Rule engine performance meets booking workflow requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage validates all rule scenarios

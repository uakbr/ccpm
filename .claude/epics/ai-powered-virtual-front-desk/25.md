# Implement branch condition evaluator

## Description
Develop a robust condition evaluator that can process branching logic in decision trees. This component will evaluate complex conditions based on user inputs, collected data, external system states, and business rules to determine the correct conversation path.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rule engine for condition evaluation
- [ ] Support for multiple condition types (equals, contains, regex, ranges)
- [ ] Boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] External data integration for condition checking
- [ ] Custom function support for complex logic
- [ ] Performance optimization for condition evaluation
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for invalid conditions
- [ ] Testing framework for condition validation

## Technical Details
- **Conditions**: Value comparisons, pattern matching, range checks
- **Logic**: Boolean operators, nested conditions, precedence
- **Data Sources**: User input, collected slots, external APIs
- **Functions**: Custom evaluators for complex business logic
- **Performance**: Efficient evaluation algorithms
- **Validation**: Condition syntax and logic verification

## Dependencies
- Task 023 (State machine for condition integration)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Condition evaluation engine: 4-6 hours
- Boolean logic implementation: 2-3 hours
- External data integration: 2-3 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Condition evaluator processes all supported condition types
- Boolean logic operations work correctly with proper precedence
- External data can be incorporated into condition evaluation
- Custom functions extend evaluation capabilities
- Performance is optimized for real-time conversation flow
- Error handling prevents invalid conditions from breaking flow

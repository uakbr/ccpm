# Implement context preservation system

## Description
Develop a context preservation system that maintains conversation state, collected data, and user preferences across multiple webhook calls and potential system restarts. This ensures continuity in the virtual front desk experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session state persistence across webhook calls
- [ ] Conversation context and history tracking
- [ ] Collected data preservation and retrieval
- [ ] User preference and profile management
- [ ] Context timeout and cleanup policies
- [ ] Encryption and security for stored context
- [ ] Performance optimization for context operations
- [ ] Integration with state machine and slot collection

## Technical Details
- **Storage**: Redis, database, or encrypted session tokens
- **Data**: Navigation state, collected slots, user preferences
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, HIPAA compliance
- **Lifecycle**: Session timeouts, cleanup, archival
- **Performance**: Fast read/write operations for real-time use
- **Integration**: Seamless with navigation and collection systems

## Dependencies
- Task 023 (State machine for context integration)
- Task 025 (Slot collection for data preservation)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Context storage system: 4-6 hours
- Security and encryption: 3-4 hours
- Lifecycle management: 2-3 hours
- Integration and testing: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Context is preserved across all webhook interactions
- Conversation state is maintained during system operations
- Collected data persists and is retrievable when needed
- User preferences enhance the conversation experience
- Security measures protect stored context information
- Performance supports real-time conversation requirements

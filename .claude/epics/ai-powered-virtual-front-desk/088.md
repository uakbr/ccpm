# Create error recovery strategies

## Description
Develop intelligent error recovery strategies that automatically resolve common issues, restore system state, and minimize impact on patient experience and clinical operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms for common error scenarios
- [ ] State restoration and data consistency management
- [ ] Recovery strategy selection based on error classification
- [ ] Recovery success tracking and optimization
- [ ] Manual intervention triggers for complex scenarios
- [ ] Recovery impact assessment and rollback capability

## Technical Details
- Common error scenario recovery:
  - Network timeout recovery with request replay
  - Database deadlock resolution with intelligent retry
  - Cache invalidation and refresh mechanisms
  - Session restoration and user state recovery
- Data consistency and state management:
  - Transaction rollback and compensation patterns
  - Eventual consistency handling across services
  - State snapshot and restoration mechanisms
  - Cross-system data synchronization recovery
- Recovery strategy selection:
  - Error type-specific recovery protocol mapping
  - Business impact consideration in strategy selection
  - Time-sensitive vs batch recovery prioritization
  - Resource availability assessment for recovery actions
- Intelligent recovery optimization:
  - Machine learning-based recovery success prediction
  - Historical recovery pattern analysis
  - Adaptive recovery strategy refinement
  - Recovery effectiveness measurement and tuning
- Manual intervention framework:
  - Complex error scenario escalation triggers
  - Administrative recovery tools and interfaces
  - Recovery workflow approval and audit trails
  - Expert system integration for guided recovery
- Recovery validation and verification:
  - Post-recovery system health verification
  - Data integrity validation after recovery
  - Service functionality testing post-recovery
  - User experience impact assessment

## Dependencies
- Graceful degradation (087)
- Transaction management framework
- State management and caching systems
- Administrative tooling infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Automatic recovery mechanisms: 8-10 hours
- State restoration systems: 6-8 hours
- Recovery strategy engine: 4-6 hours
- Validation and monitoring: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- Automatic recovery resolves common error scenarios
- State restoration maintains data consistency
- Recovery strategy selection optimizes for business impact
- Manual intervention available for complex scenarios
- Recovery success rates meet operational targets
- System resilience significantly improved through recovery mechanisms

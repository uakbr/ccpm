## Description
Create specialized test suite for speech recognition functionality including accuracy testing, noise handling, and various accent/language variations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create test corpus with diverse speech samples
- [ ] Test speech recognition accuracy across different accents and languages
- [ ] Validate noise filtering and audio quality handling
- [ ] Test wake word detection and voice activity detection
- [ ] Implement confidence score validation and thresholds

## Technical Details
- Build test corpus with medical terminology and common phrases
- Implement automated speech recognition accuracy measurement
- Create test scenarios for various audio quality conditions
- Test integration with multiple speech recognition providers
- Implement A/B testing framework for speech recognition models

## Dependencies
- Unit test framework must be established
- Speech recognition service integration required

## Effort Estimate
L (16-24 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Speech recognition test suite covers all supported languages/accents
- Accuracy benchmarks established and monitored
- Noise handling capabilities validated
- Speech recognition confidence thresholds optimized
- Automated testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline

# Create speech input parser

## Description
Develop a natural language parser that converts transcribed speech into structured data for appointment booking operations, including intent recognition and entity extraction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Intent classification for appointment-related requests
- [ ] Entity extraction for dates, times, providers, appointment types
- [ ] Handling of conversational speech patterns and disfluencies
- [ ] Support for multiple ways of expressing the same intent
- [ ] Integration with confidence scoring for parser results
- [ ] Structured output format for downstream processing

## Technical Details
- Implement NLP pipeline for intent recognition:
  - Book appointment
  - Cancel appointment
  - Reschedule appointment
  - Check availability
  - Patient information requests
- Develop entity extraction for:
  - Temporal expressions (dates, times, durations)
  - Provider names and specialties
  - Appointment types and reasons
  - Patient identifiers
- Handle speech-specific challenges:
  - Filler words and hesitations
  - Repeated or corrected phrases
  - Incomplete sentences
- Create parser confidence scoring
- Implement fallback to clarifying questions

## Dependencies
- ASR speech models (031)
- Confidence scoring system (032)
- Healthcare terminology and provider databases
- NLP libraries and models

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Intent classification development: 8-10 hours
- Entity extraction implementation: 8-10 hours
- Speech pattern handling: 4-6 hours
- Integration and testing: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Parser accurately identifies appointment-related intents (>85% accuracy)
- Entity extraction works reliably for key appointment data
- System handles common speech patterns and disfluencies
- Parser output is in structured format suitable for downstream processing
- Comprehensive test suite covers various speech input scenarios

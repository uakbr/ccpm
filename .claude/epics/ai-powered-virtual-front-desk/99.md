# Implement SMS retry mechanism

## Description
Create intelligent SMS retry system that handles failed deliveries with exponential backoff, alternative routing, and smart retry policies to maximize delivery success rates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Exponential backoff retry strategy
- [ ] Failure categorization with retry eligibility assessment
- [ ] Alternative carrier and routing for retries
- [ ] Maximum retry limits and timeout handling
- [ ] Retry performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Cost-aware retry decision making

## Technical Details
- Retry strategy implementation:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Configurable base delay and maximum retry intervals
  - Retry attempt scheduling with persistent queue
  - Time-sensitive message handling with reduced retry windows
- Failure categorization and retry eligibility:
  - Permanent failure detection (invalid numbers, blocked)
  - Temporary failure identification (network issues, carrier problems)
  - Rate limiting failure handling with delayed retry
  - Carrier-specific error code interpretation
- Alternative routing and carrier selection:
  - Fallback carrier selection for failed primary deliveries
  - Geographic routing optimization for international messages
  - Carrier performance-based routing decisions
  - Cost-optimized alternative routing strategies
- Retry limits and timeout management:
  - Message type-specific retry limits (urgent vs informational)
  - Maximum retry duration enforcement
  - Message expiration handling for time-sensitive content
  - Dead letter queue for permanently failed messages
- Performance monitoring and optimization:
  - Retry success rate tracking by failure type
  - Carrier performance analysis for routing decisions
  - Cost impact analysis of retry strategies
  - Retry pattern analysis for optimization opportunities
- Smart retry policies:
  - Machine learning-based retry success prediction
  - Historical performance-based retry scheduling
  - Patient preference-aware retry timing
  - Business rule integration for retry decisions

## Dependencies
- SMS delivery logic (096)
- Message queue infrastructure
- Carrier performance monitoring
- Machine learning platform

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Retry strategy and backoff logic: 4-6 hours
- Failure categorization and routing: 3-4 hours
- Performance monitoring: 2-3 hours
- Smart retry policies: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Exponential backoff retry strategy improves delivery rates
- Failure categorization prevents unnecessary retry attempts
- Alternative routing optimizes delivery success
- Retry limits prevent excessive costs and delays
- Performance monitoring provides optimization insights
- Smart policies maximize delivery success while minimizing costs

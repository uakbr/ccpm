# Implement call escalation logic

## Description
Create intelligent call escalation system that routes complex or failed interactions to human agents with appropriate context, priority, and resolution capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic escalation triggers based on error scenarios
- [ ] Agent routing based on expertise and availability
- [ ] Context preservation and handoff to human agents
- [ ] Priority-based escalation queue management
- [ ] Escalation success tracking and optimization
- [ ] Integration with existing contact center systems

## Technical Details
- Escalation trigger mechanisms:
  - Multiple consecutive failures in appointment booking
  - Complex patient requests beyond AI capabilities
  - High-priority patient or emergency appointment needs
  - System errors requiring immediate human intervention
- Agent routing and selection:
  - Skill-based routing for specialized appointment types
  - Availability-based routing with real-time status
  - Language preference matching for patient communication
  - Provider relationship consideration in agent assignment
- Context preservation and handoff:
  - Complete conversation history and intent capture
  - Patient information and preferences transfer
  - Failed attempt history and error context
  - Recommended resolution strategies for agents
- Priority and queue management:
  - Emergency appointment escalation with immediate routing
  - VIP patient prioritization in escalation queue
  - Time-based priority escalation for waiting calls
  - Load balancing across available agents
- Integration with contact center:
  - CRM system integration for agent context
  - Telephony integration for seamless call transfer
  - Agent desktop integration with appointment systems
  - Real-time collaboration tools for complex cases
- Performance monitoring and optimization:
  - Escalation rate tracking and trend analysis
  - Agent resolution success rate monitoring
  - Average handling time measurement and optimization
  - Patient satisfaction tracking for escalated calls

## Dependencies
- Error classification system (084)
- Contact center integration platform
- Agent desktop and CRM systems
- Call routing and telephony infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Escalation trigger logic: 4-6 hours
- Agent routing system: 6-8 hours
- Context handoff mechanism: 3-4 hours
- Integration and monitoring: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Escalation triggers activate appropriately for complex scenarios
- Agent routing optimizes for expertise and availability
- Context preservation ensures effective human handoff
- Priority queue management handles urgent cases efficiently
- Integration with contact center systems functional
- Performance metrics provide insights for optimization

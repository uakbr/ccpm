# Create error logging framework

## Description
Build comprehensive error logging framework that captures, structures, and stores error information for debugging, analysis, and compliance while ensuring performance and scalability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Structured error logging with consistent schema
- [ ] Performance-optimized logging with async processing
- [ ] Log level management and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Context enrichment with correlation tracking
- [ ] Secure logging with sensitive data protection
- [ ] Integration with log aggregation and analysis tools

## Technical Details
- Structured logging implementation:
  - JSON-formatted log entries with consistent schema
  - Standardized field naming and data types
  - Hierarchical error context with nested information
  - Correlation ID tracking across service boundaries
- Asynchronous logging architecture:
  - Non-blocking log writing with background processing
  - Batched log transmission for improved performance
  - Circuit breaker protection for logging infrastructure
  - Local log buffering with overflow protection
- Log level and filtering management:
  - Dynamic log level configuration without restart
  - Context-aware log level adjustment
  - Sampling strategies for high-volume scenarios
  - Environment-specific logging configurations
- Context enrichment and correlation:
  - Request tracing across microservices
  - User session and patient context inclusion
  - Service mesh integration for distributed tracing
  - Business process correlation and workflow tracking
- Security and compliance features:
  - Automatic PII detection and masking
  - HIPAA-compliant logging with encryption
  - Access control and audit trail for log access
  - Secure log transmission and storage
- Integration and observability:
  - ELK stack integration for search and analysis
  - Metrics extraction from log patterns
  - Real-time log streaming for monitoring
  - Log-based alerting and notification system

## Dependencies
- Error classification system (084)
- Log aggregation infrastructure (ELK, Splunk, etc.)
- Message queue or streaming platform
- Security and encryption services

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Structured logging framework: 6-8 hours
- Async processing and performance optimization: 4-6 hours
- Security and compliance features: 3-4 hours
- Integration and tooling: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Structured logging captures comprehensive error information
- Asynchronous processing maintains application performance
- Log levels and filtering provide operational flexibility
- Context enrichment enables effective debugging and analysis
- Security features protect sensitive information
- Integration with analysis tools enables operational insights

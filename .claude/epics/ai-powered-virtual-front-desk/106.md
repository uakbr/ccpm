# Implement log aggregation

## Description
Create centralized log aggregation system that collects, processes, and analyzes logs from all system components to provide comprehensive operational insights and debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Centralized log collection from all system components
- [ ] Structured log parsing and enrichment
- [ ] Real-time log streaming and search capabilities
- [ ] Log correlation and trace reconstruction
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant log storage and access controls
- [ ] Automated log analysis and pattern detection

## Technical Details
- Log collection architecture:
  - Distributed log agents on all servers and containers
  - Application-level log forwarding with structured format
  - Network device and infrastructure log collection
  - Third-party service log integration (Twilio, payment processors)
- Log processing and enrichment:
  - Structured log parsing with field extraction
  - Log normalization across different sources and formats
  - Contextual enrichment with correlation IDs and metadata
  - Sensitive data masking and PII protection
- Real-time streaming and indexing:
  - High-throughput log ingestion with buffering
  - Real-time indexing for immediate searchability
  - Log-based metrics extraction and alerting
  - Stream processing for pattern detection and anomalies
- Search and query capabilities:
  - Full-text search across all log data
  - Field-based filtering and complex query construction
  - Time-based search with efficient time-series indexing
  - Saved searches and query templates for common investigations
- Log correlation and tracing:
  - Request tracing across microservices using correlation IDs
  - Call flow reconstruction from distributed logs
  - Error propagation tracking and root cause analysis
  - Business process correlation across system boundaries
- Storage and retention management:
  - Tiered storage for different log types and ages
  - Automated archival and compression for long-term storage
  - HIPAA-compliant retention policies and secure deletion
  - Cost optimization through intelligent storage management
- Security and compliance:
  - Role-based access control for log data
  - Audit logging for log access and modifications
  - Encryption in transit and at rest
  - HIPAA compliance validation and reporting

## Dependencies
- Datadog integration (100) or ELK stack infrastructure
- Log shipping agents (Fluentd, Logstash, or similar)
- Search and analytics engine (Elasticsearch or similar)
- Security and encryption services

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Log collection and processing setup: 6-8 hours
- Search and correlation capabilities: 4-6 hours
- Security and compliance features: 3-4 hours
- Storage optimization and management: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Centralized log aggregation collects logs from all system components
- Real-time search and analysis capabilities enable rapid debugging
- Log correlation reconstructs complete request flows
- HIPAA-compliant storage and access controls protect sensitive data
- Automated analysis identifies patterns and anomalies
- Storage optimization manages costs while maintaining accessibility

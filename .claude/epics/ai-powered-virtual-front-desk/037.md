# Implement accent normalization

## Description
Develop accent normalization and adaptation capabilities to improve speech recognition accuracy across diverse patient populations with different accents, dialects, and speaking patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-accent speech model support and configuration
- [ ] Dynamic accent detection and adaptation
- [ ] Pronunciation variation handling for medical terms
- [ ] Performance monitoring across different accent groups
- [ ] Fairness metrics to ensure equitable service quality
- [ ] Accent-specific confidence score adjustments

## Technical Details
- Implement accent detection algorithms:
  - Phonetic analysis for accent classification
  - Regional dialect identification
  - Speaking rate and rhythm analysis
- Develop accent adaptation strategies:
  - Model switching based on detected accent
  - Dynamic acoustic model interpolation
  - Pronunciation dictionary adjustments
- Create accent-aware processing:
  - Confidence score recalibration per accent group
  - Timeout adjustment for non-native speakers
  - Alternative pronunciation recognition
- Implement fairness monitoring:
  - Accuracy tracking by accent/demographic group
  - Performance parity metrics
  - Bias detection and mitigation

## Dependencies
- ASR speech models (031)
- Confidence scoring system (032)
- Diverse accent training data
- Demographic analytics framework

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Accent detection system: 8-10 hours
- Adaptation algorithms: 10-12 hours
- Fairness monitoring: 4-6 hours
- Testing and validation: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- System accurately detects major accent groups
- Speech recognition accuracy is consistent across accent groups
- Fairness metrics show equitable performance
- Accent adaptation improves recognition without degrading other groups
- Performance monitoring dashboard is operational
- Documentation includes accent handling guidelines

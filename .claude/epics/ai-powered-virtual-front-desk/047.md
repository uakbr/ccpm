# Create patient record caching

## Description
Implement intelligent caching system for patient records to improve system performance, reduce database load, and provide faster response times for frequently accessed patient information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-level caching strategy for patient data
- [ ] Cache invalidation and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant cache security
- [ ] Configurable cache policies and expiration
- [ ] Cache warming for frequently accessed records

## Technical Details
- Implement caching layers:
  - In-memory caching for active sessions
  - Distributed caching for scalability
  - Database query result caching
  - Search result caching with TTL
- Develop cache management:
  - Intelligent cache warming based on usage patterns
  - Automatic cache invalidation on data updates
  - Cache versioning for data consistency
  - Memory management and eviction policies
- Create performance optimization:
  - Cache hit/miss ratio monitoring
  - Response time improvement tracking
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Cache efficiency analytics
- Implement security measures:
  - Encrypted cache storage
  - Access control for cached data
  - Secure cache transmission
  - Audit logging for cache access

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient search functionality (040)
- Caching infrastructure (Redis, Memcached)
- Security and encryption frameworks

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Cache implementation: 4-6 hours
- Performance optimization: 2-3 hours
- Security measures: 2-3 hours
- Monitoring and analytics: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient record caching significantly improves response times
- Cache invalidation maintains data consistency
- Security measures protect cached patient data
- Performance monitoring shows measurable improvements
- Cache policies are configurable and optimized
- System scales effectively with cached data

# Implement dynamic prompt generation

## Description
Develop dynamic prompt generation capabilities that create contextual, personalized voice prompts based on collected user data, conversation history, and current system state. This enhances the user experience by providing relevant and personalized interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template-based prompt generation with variable substitution
- [ ] Context-aware prompt selection and customization
- [ ] Personalization based on collected user data
- [ ] Conditional prompt content based on system state
- [ ] Multi-language prompt generation support
- [ ] Fallback prompts for missing data or errors
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time generation
- [ ] Integration with voice prompt management system

## Technical Details
- **Templates**: Variable substitution, conditional content
- **Context**: User data, conversation history, system state
- **Personalization**: Name, preferences, appointment history
- **Conditions**: Dynamic content based on business rules
- **Languages**: Multi-language template support
- **Performance**: Cached generation, optimized processing

## Dependencies
- Task 015 (Voice prompt management system)
- Task 025 (Slot collection for user data)
- Task 026 (Context preservation for personalization)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Template engine development: 4-5 hours
- Context integration: 3-4 hours
- Personalization logic: 2-3 hours
- Performance optimization and testing: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Dynamic prompts are generated based on conversation context
- Personalization uses collected user data appropriately
- Template system supports conditional and variable content
- Multi-language generation works correctly
- Performance supports real-time conversation requirements
- Fallback mechanisms handle missing or invalid data

# Create appointment data models

## Description
Design and implement comprehensive data models for appointment management, including appointment entities, scheduling rules, availability tracking, and relationship management within the healthcare system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Appointment entity model with all required fields
- [ ] Provider availability and schedule models
- [ ] Appointment type and service configuration models
- [ ] Scheduling rule and constraint models
- [ ] Appointment status and lifecycle management
- [ ] Integration with patient and provider data models

## Technical Details
- Design core appointment entities:
  - Appointment details (date, time, duration, type, status)
  - Patient and provider associations
  - Location and resource requirements
  - Scheduling metadata (created, modified, cancelled)
  - Appointment notes and special instructions
- Implement availability models:
  - Provider schedule templates and overrides
  - Availability slots with duration and capacity
  - Blocked time and unavailability periods
  - Holiday and closure schedules
- Create appointment type configuration:
  - Service definitions with duration and requirements
  - Booking rules and constraints
  - Insurance and eligibility requirements
  - Preparation instructions and prerequisites
- Develop scheduling constraints:
  - Buffer time between appointments
  - Appointment sequencing rules
  - Resource allocation and room assignments
  - Provider specialization matching

## Dependencies
- Database infrastructure
- Patient data models
- Provider and resource management systems
- Healthcare scheduling standards

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Data model design: 6-8 hours
- Implementation and relationships: 6-8 hours
- Validation and constraints: 2-4 hours
- Testing and documentation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Appointment data models support complete scheduling workflow
- All required fields and relationships are properly defined
- Models accommodate various appointment types and scheduling scenarios
- Data integrity constraints prevent invalid scheduling states
- Performance is optimized for high-volume scheduling operations
- Comprehensive documentation is available

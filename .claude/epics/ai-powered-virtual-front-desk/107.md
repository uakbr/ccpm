# Create monitoring tests

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite for all monitoring and observability components to ensure reliable metrics collection, accurate alerting, and effective dashboard functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for metrics collection and processing
- [ ] Integration tests for monitoring system connectivity
- [ ] Alert testing with simulated failure scenarios
- [ ] Dashboard functionality and performance testing
- [ ] Load testing for high-volume metrics ingestion
- [ ] End-to-end monitoring workflow validation

## Technical Details
- Metrics collection testing:
  - Unit tests for all custom metrics and business logic
  - Data accuracy validation for collected metrics
  - Metrics aggregation and calculation verification
  - Time-series data integrity and consistency testing
- Monitoring system integration testing:
  - Datadog agent connectivity and data transmission
  - Log aggregation pipeline end-to-end testing
  - External monitoring service integration validation
  - Cross-system metrics correlation verification
- Alert system testing:
  - Threshold-based alert trigger verification
  - Anomaly detection accuracy and false positive testing
  - Escalation procedure and notification delivery testing
  - Alert suppression and correlation logic validation
- Dashboard testing:
  - Widget rendering and data visualization accuracy
  - Interactive functionality and drill-down capability testing
  - Mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
  - Dashboard performance under high data volume
- Load and performance testing:
  - High-volume metrics ingestion capacity testing
  - Monitoring system performance impact measurement
  - Dashboard response time under concurrent user load
  - Storage and query performance optimization validation
- End-to-end workflow testing:
  - Complete monitoring pipeline from data collection to visualization
  - Incident detection to resolution workflow validation
  - Monitoring data flow through all system components
  - Business process monitoring and alerting validation
- Disaster recovery and failover testing:
  - Monitoring system failover and recovery procedures
  - Data retention and backup validation
  - Service degradation impact on monitoring capabilities
  - Recovery time measurement and optimization

## Dependencies
- All monitoring components (100-106)
- Test automation framework
- Load testing tools
- Mock services for failure simulation

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Metrics and integration testing: 8-10 hours
- Alert and dashboard testing: 6-8 hours
- Load and performance testing: 6-8 hours
- End-to-end and disaster recovery testing: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures monitoring system reliability
- Integration tests validate connectivity with all external services
- Alert testing confirms accurate and timely notifications
- Dashboard tests ensure reliable data visualization
- Load testing validates system performance under high volume
- End-to-end tests confirm complete monitoring workflow functionality

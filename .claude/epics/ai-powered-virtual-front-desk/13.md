# Configure speech recognition settings

## Description
Configure and optimize Twilio's speech recognition capabilities for the virtual front desk system. This includes setting up language models, confidence thresholds, and handling various speech patterns commonly encountered in medical appointment scheduling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Speech recognition language and dialect configured
- [ ] Confidence threshold tuning for optimal accuracy
- [ ] Medical terminology and proper names handling
- [ ] Timeout settings configured for speech input
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for low confidence recognition
- [ ] Speech hints configured for common responses
- [ ] Recognition error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Performance monitoring for speech accuracy

## Technical Details
- **Language Model**: en-US with medical domain adaptation
- **Confidence Levels**: Configurable thresholds (0.5-0.8 range)
- **Speech Hints**: Common medical terms, provider names
- **Timeouts**: Speech detection and silence timeouts
- **Fallbacks**: DTMF backup, human transfer options
- **Monitoring**: Recognition accuracy and failure rates

## Dependencies
- Task 011 (TwiML handler for speech integration)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Speech configuration setup: 3-4 hours
- Medical terminology integration: 4-5 hours
- Confidence and timeout tuning: 3-4 hours
- Testing and optimization: 3-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Speech recognition accurately processes common requests
- Medical terms and names are recognized properly
- Confidence thresholds provide optimal user experience
- Fallback mechanisms work when speech fails
- Timeout settings balance accuracy and responsiveness
- Performance metrics show acceptable recognition rates

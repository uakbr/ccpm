# Create speech timeout handling

## Description
Implement comprehensive timeout handling for speech recognition to manage silent periods, partial speech, and abandoned interactions gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configurable timeout periods for different interaction states
- [ ] Progressive timeout warnings before session termination
- [ ] Graceful handling of partial speech input
- [ ] Automatic session cleanup and resource management
- [ ] Timeout behavior customization based on interaction context
- [ ] Analytics tracking for timeout patterns and optimization

## Technical Details
- Implement multiple timeout types:
  - Initial silence timeout (waiting for first speech)
  - Inter-speech timeout (pauses between words/sentences)
  - Total interaction timeout (maximum session duration)
  - Partial input timeout (incomplete responses)
- Develop timeout warning system:
  - Progressive alerts before timeout
  - User-friendly timeout messages
  - Option to extend session or get help
- Create context-aware timeout management:
  - Longer timeouts for complex tasks
  - Shorter timeouts for simple confirmations
  - Adaptive timeouts based on user behavior
- Implement resource cleanup:
  - Audio stream termination
  - Memory and connection cleanup
  - Session state preservation for recovery

## Dependencies
- ASR speech models (031)
- Voice activity detection
- Session management system
- Audio resource management

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Timeout logic implementation: 4-6 hours
- Warning system development: 2-3 hours
- Resource cleanup mechanisms: 2-3 hours
- Testing and optimization: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Multiple timeout types are implemented and configurable
- Users receive appropriate warnings before timeout
- Sessions terminate gracefully with proper cleanup
- Timeout behavior adapts to interaction context
- Analytics provide insights for timeout optimization
- No resource leaks occur during timeout scenarios

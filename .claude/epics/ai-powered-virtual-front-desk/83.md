# Create reschedule audit logging

## Description
Implement comprehensive audit logging system for all rescheduling activities to ensure compliance, security, and operational transparency with detailed tracking and reporting capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete reschedule operation logging
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant audit trail
- [ ] Real-time log streaming and monitoring
- [ ] Searchable audit log interface
- [ ] Automated compliance reporting
- [ ] Log integrity and tamper protection

## Technical Details
- Comprehensive audit event capture:
  - User authentication and authorization events
  - Reschedule request initiation and completion
  - System decision points and business rule evaluations
  - External system interactions and API calls

  - Breach detection and notification capabilities
  - Encrypted log storage with access controls
  - Retention period compliance (6+ years)
- Log data structure and format:
  - Structured logging with consistent schema
  - JSON format with standardized field naming
  - Correlation IDs for tracing complete workflows
  - Contextual information capture (session, IP, location)
  - Sensitive data masking and redaction
- Real-time monitoring and alerting:
  - Suspicious activity pattern detection
  - Unusual access pattern monitoring
  - Failed authentication attempt tracking

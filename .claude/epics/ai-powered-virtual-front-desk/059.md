# Implement appointment booking API

## Description
Create a robust, secure appointment booking API that handles appointment creation, modification, and cancellation with proper validation, conflict detection, and integration capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints for appointment operations
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- [ ] Atomic booking operations with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Real-time availability checking and reservation
- [ ] Integration with external healthcare systems
- [ ] API security and rate limiting

## Technical Details
- Implement core API endpoints:
  - POST /appointments (create new appointment)
  - PUT /appointments/{id} (modify existing appointment)
  - DELETE /appointments/{id} (cancel appointment)
  - GET /appointments/availability (check slot availability)
- Develop booking workflow:
  - Multi-step booking with provisional reservations
  - Timeout-based reservation cleanup
  - Atomic operations with transaction management
  - Conflict detection and resolution
- Create validation and error handling:
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Business rule enforcement
  - Clear error messages and codes
  - Graceful degradation for system issues
- Implement security measures:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and abuse prevention
  - Data encryption and secure transmission
  - Audit logging for all booking operations

## Dependencies
- Appointment data models (054)
- Slot availability search (055)
- Provider selection logic (057)
- Security and authentication frameworks

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- API endpoint implementation: 8-10 hours
- Validation and error handling: 4-6 hours
- Security and authentication: 3-4 hours
- Testing and documentation: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- API successfully handles all appointment booking operations
- Booking operations are atomic and handle conflicts appropriately
- API security meets healthcare industry standards
- Comprehensive error handling provides clear feedback
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Integration testing validates end-to-end functionality

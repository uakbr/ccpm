# Create fallback mechanisms

## Description
Implement robust fallback mechanisms that provide alternative functionality and maintain service availability when primary systems fail or degrade.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Primary to fallback system switching logic
- [ ] Multiple fallback levels with priority ordering
- [ ] Fallback health monitoring and automatic recovery
- [ ] Data consistency maintenance across fallback systems
- [ ] User transparent fallback activation
- [ ] Fallback performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Details
- Fallback system architecture:
  - Primary-secondary-tertiary fallback hierarchy
  - Independent fallback data sources and services
  - Cross-region fallback for geographic redundancy
  - Offline mode with cached data utilization
- Switching logic and triggers:
  - Health check failure-based switching
  - Performance degradation threshold triggers
  - Circuit breaker integration for automatic switching
  - Manual fallback activation for planned maintenance
- Data synchronization and consistency:
  - Real-time data replication to fallback systems
  - Eventual consistency handling across fallbacks
  - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
  - Data freshness validation and staleness handling
- Service-specific fallback strategies:
  - Appointment booking with simplified workflow
  - Patient verification with cached credentials
  - Provider calendar with snapshot data
  - Payment processing with stored payment methods
- User experience preservation:
  - Seamless fallback activation without user awareness
  - Feature limitation communication when necessary
  - Alternative workflow guidance during fallback mode
  - Automatic restoration notification when primary recovers
- Health monitoring and recovery:
  - Continuous fallback system health monitoring
  - Automatic primary system recovery detection
  - Gradual traffic migration back to primary
  - Fallback system performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Graceful degradation (087)
- Error recovery strategies (088)
- Data replication infrastructure
- Health monitoring systems

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Fallback architecture and switching: 8-10 hours
- Data synchronization mechanisms: 6-8 hours
- Service-specific fallback implementation: 6-8 hours
- Monitoring and recovery automation: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Fallback systems provide alternative functionality during failures
- Switching logic activates fallbacks automatically and appropriately
- Data consistency maintained across primary and fallback systems
- User experience remains acceptable during fallback operation
- Health monitoring enables automatic recovery to primary systems
- Fallback mechanisms significantly improve overall system availability

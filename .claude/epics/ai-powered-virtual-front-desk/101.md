# Create metrics collection system

## Description
Build comprehensive metrics collection system that captures business, operational, and technical metrics from all components of the virtual front desk system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Business metrics collection (bookings, success rates, revenue)
- [ ] Operational metrics tracking (call volume, queue times, resolution rates)
- [ ] Technical metrics monitoring (response times, error rates, throughput)
- [ ] Real-time metrics streaming and aggregation
- [ ] Historical metrics storage and trend analysis
- [ ] Metrics API for external consumption

## Technical Details
- Business metrics collection:
  - Appointment booking success and failure rates
  - Revenue impact and cost per interaction
  - Patient satisfaction scores and Net Promoter Score (NPS)
  - Provider utilization and schedule optimization metrics
- Operational metrics tracking:
  - Call volume and traffic patterns by time of day
  - Average call duration and interaction complexity
  - Queue wait times and abandonment rates
  - Agent escalation rates and resolution times
- Technical performance metrics:
  - API response times and throughput measurements
  - Error rates and failure categorization
  - Database query performance and connection pool metrics
  - Speech recognition accuracy and processing times
- Real-time metrics streaming:
  - Event-driven metrics collection using message queues
  - Stream processing for real-time aggregation
  - Low-latency metrics delivery to dashboards
  - Real-time alerting based on metric thresholds
- Historical data management:
  - Time-series database for efficient metrics storage
  - Data retention policies for different metric types
  - Data compression and archiving strategies
  - Historical trend analysis and forecasting
- Metrics API and integration:
  - RESTful API for metrics query and retrieval
  - GraphQL interface for flexible data access
  - Webhook integration for external system notifications
  - Data export capabilities for external analysis tools

## Dependencies
- Datadog integration (100)
- Time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Message queue infrastructure
- API gateway and authentication

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Business and operational metrics: 6-8 hours
- Technical metrics and instrumentation: 4-6 hours
- Real-time streaming and storage: 3-4 hours
- API and integration development: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive metrics collection covers all system aspects
- Real-time streaming provides immediate insights
- Historical storage enables trend analysis and forecasting
- Metrics API enables external system integration
- Data retention policies optimize storage costs
- Performance impact of metrics collection minimized

## Description
Implement comprehensive test automation pipeline that orchestrates all test types, manages test environments, and provides fast feedback on code quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline with all test stages
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback
- [ ] Establish test result aggregation and reporting
- [ ] Create quality gates based on test results
- [ ] Implement test failure analysis and notification

## Technical Details
- Configure GitHub Actions or Jenkins for test orchestration
- Implement test parallelization and load balancing
- Create test result dashboards and notifications
- Set up automatic retry for flaky tests
- Implement test environment provisioning and cleanup

## Dependencies
- Regression test suite must be operational
- CI/CD infrastructure must be available

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Test automation pipeline operational for all test types
- Test execution time optimized through parallelization
- Quality gates prevent deployment of failing code
- Test results accessible through dashboards
- Test failure notifications reach appropriate team members

# Epic: AI-Powered Virtual Front Desk

## Overview

Implement a cloud-native, serverless IVR system using Twilio Programmable Voice for telephony, Twilio Functions (Node.js 22) for business logic, and NexHealth API as the integration layer to eClinicalWorks EHR. The system will use a state-machine architecture driven by configurable JSON decision trees, enabling rapid iteration of call flows without code changes. All interactions will be HIPAA-compliant with TLS 1.3 encryption, minimal data retention, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Telephony Platform:** Twilio Programmable Voice with multi-provider ASR (twilio-picks-en-US-telephony model)
  - *Rationale:* Industry-leading reliability, built-in HIPAA compliance, automatic speech provider failover
- **Serverless Runtime:** Twilio Functions with Node.js 22 LTS
  - *Rationale:* <50ms cold starts, integrated with Twilio ecosystem, no infrastructure management
- **EHR Integration:** NexHealth API v1 as middleware to eClinicalWorks
  - *Rationale:* Proven integration, handles HL7 complexity, provides unified API interface
- **State Management:** URL-encoded parameters with Call SID as session key
  - *Rationale:* Stateless design, horizontal scalability, no external dependencies

### Design Patterns
- **Decision Tree Pattern:** JSON-driven conversation flow for non-technical configurability
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** For NexHealth API calls with automatic fallback to human operator
- **Retry Pattern:** Exponential backoff for transient failures (max 3 attempts)
- **Idempotency Pattern:** Using Call SID + timestamp for preventing duplicate bookings

### Security Architecture
- **Zero-Trust Model:** All external calls over TLS 1.3, no data at rest
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal API permissions, read-only where possible
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple validation layers, confidence scoring, human fallback

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
*Note: This is primarily a voice interface system - no traditional UI components*

#### Voice User Interface (VUI)
- **TwiML Response Generator:** Dynamic XML generation for Twilio voice instructions
- **Prompt Management System:** Configurable voice prompts with variable substitution
- **Speech Recognition Handler:** Dual-mode input (speech + DTMF) with confidence scoring
- **Audio Feedback Controller:** Voice speed adjustment, reprompt logic, barge-in support

#### State Management
- **Call State Tracker:** Session management using URL parameters
- **Decision Tree Navigator:** JSON-based flow control with branching logic
- **Context Preservation:** Maintain call context through transfers and errors

### Backend Services

#### Core Twilio Function (`ivr-handler.js`)
```javascript
// Main entry point structure
exports.handler = async (context, event, callback) => {
  // Parse input (speech/DTMF)
  // Load decision tree
  // Navigate state machine
  // Execute business logic
  // Generate TwiML response
}
```

#### API Integration Layer (`nexhealthClient.js`)
- **Patient Management:**
  - `searchPatient(firstName, lastName, dob)` - Find existing patients
  - `createPatient(demographics)` - Register new patients
  - `validatePatient(patientId)` - Verify patient identity

- **Appointment Services:**
  - `fetchAvailableSlots(criteria)` - Get open appointment times
  - `bookAppointment(patientId, slotId)` - Create new appointment
  - `rescheduleAppointment(appointmentId, newSlot)` - Update existing appointment
  - `getUpcomingAppointments(patientId)` - List patient's scheduled visits

#### Business Logic Components
- **Input Parser:** Convert speech/DTMF to structured data
- **Date/Time Formatter:** Handle timezone conversions and natural language dates
- **Appointment Type Mapper:** Match spoken reasons to appointment_type_id
- **Validation Engine:** Ensure data completeness and format correctness
- **Error Handler:** Graceful degradation with human escalation

### Infrastructure

#### Deployment Architecture
- **Environment Strategy:**
  - Development: Separate Twilio phone number, dev NexHealth sandbox
  - Staging: Production-like with test data
  - Production: Primary clinic phone number with gradual rollout

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  ```yaml
  # GitHub Actions workflow
  - Lint and format code (ESLint)
  - Run unit tests (Mocha/Chai)
  - Security scan (npm audit)
  - Deploy to Twilio (twilio-run)
  - Smoke test IVR flow
  - Update monitoring dashboards
  ```

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics Collection:**
  - Call volume and duration tracking
  - API response times (NexHealth, Twilio)
  - Speech recognition confidence scores
  - Escalation rates and reasons

- **Logging Strategy:**
  - Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
  - PHI-safe logging (no names, DOB, etc.)
  - Centralized aggregation (Datadog)
  - 6-year retention for HIPAA compliance

- **Alerting Thresholds:**
  - Automation rate < 90% → PagerDuty alert
  - API latency > 2s P95 → Slack notification
  - Error rate > 1% → Engineering escalation

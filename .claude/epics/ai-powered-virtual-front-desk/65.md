# Create appointment reason parser

## Description
Develop natural language parser that extracts and interprets appointment reasons from patient voice input, mapping them to appropriate medical codes and appointment types for better scheduling and care coordination.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Natural language appointment reason extraction
- [ ] Medical terminology recognition and standardization
- [ ] Symptom and condition mapping to appointment types
- [ ] Privacy-compliant reason collection and storage
- [ ] Integration with provider specialization matching
- [ ] Urgency level assessment from appointment reasons

## Technical Details
- Implement reason extraction algorithms:
  - Symptom and condition keyword recognition
  - Medical terminology parsing and standardization
  - Context-aware reason interpretation
  - Multi-symptom and complex reason handling
- Develop medical code mapping:
  - ICD-10 code association where appropriate
  - Appointment type recommendation based on reasons
  - Procedure code mapping for specific requests
  - Specialty service routing based on conditions
- Create urgency assessment:
  - Emergency vs. urgent vs. routine classification
  - Triage-level recommendations
  - Priority scheduling based on medical necessity
  - Red flag condition detection and escalation
- Implement privacy and compliance:
  - HIPAA-compliant reason storage
  - Sensitive information handling
  - Patient consent for reason collection
  - Audit logging for medical information access

## Dependencies
- Appointment type mapping (056)
- Medical terminology databases
- Privacy and compliance frameworks
- Provider specialization data

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Natural language processing: 10-12 hours
- Medical code mapping: 8-10 hours
- Urgency assessment: 4-6 hours
- Privacy and compliance: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Parser accurately extracts appointment reasons from voice input
- Medical terminology is properly recognized and standardized
- Appointment types are appropriately matched to reasons
- Urgency levels are correctly assessed for triage purposes
- Privacy requirements are met for sensitive medical information
- Integration improves appointment scheduling relevance and efficiency

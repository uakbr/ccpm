# Implement patient verification logic

## Description
Create a secure patient identity verification system that confirms patient identity through voice interaction while maintaining HIPAA compliance and preventing unauthorized access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-factor verification using demographic information
- [ ] Voice-based identity confirmation workflow
- [ ] Configurable verification requirements based on access level
- [ ] Failed verification handling and security lockout
- [ ] Audit logging for all verification attempts
- [ ] Integration with existing authentication systems

## Technical Details
- Implement verification methods:
  - Date of birth verification
  - Last 4 digits of SSN confirmation
  - Address verification (partial)
  - Phone number confirmation
  - Previous appointment date verification
- Develop verification workflow:
  - Progressive verification (start with basic info)
  - Multiple verification factors for sensitive operations
  - Configurable verification thresholds
  - Clear prompts and instructions for users
- Create security controls:
  - Maximum verification attempts with lockout
  - Suspicious activity detection and logging
  - Time-based verification expiration
  - Role-based verification requirements
- Implement audit and compliance:
  - Comprehensive logging of verification attempts
  - HIPAA-compliant access tracking
  - Security incident reporting
  - Regular verification pattern analysis

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient search functionality (040)
- Security and logging infrastructure
- HIPAA compliance framework

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Verification algorithm development: 6-8 hours
- Security controls implementation: 4-6 hours
- Workflow integration: 3-4 hours
- Audit and compliance features: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient verification works reliably with voice input
- Security controls prevent unauthorized access
- Verification requirements are configurable and appropriate
- All verification attempts are properly logged and audited
- Failed verification scenarios are handled securely
- HIPAA compliance requirements are met

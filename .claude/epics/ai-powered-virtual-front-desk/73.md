# Create rescheduling data models

## Description
Design and implement data models to support appointment rescheduling functionality, including reschedule requests, tracking, and historical data structures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RescheduleRequest data model with all required fields
- [ ] RescheduleHistory model for audit trail
- [ ] RescheduleStatus enumeration for tracking states
- [ ] Database schema migration scripts
- [ ] Data validation rules and constraints
- [ ] Model relationships with existing appointment entities

## Technical Details
- Implement core data models:
  - RescheduleRequest: original appointment ID, new datetime, reason, status, requester info
  - RescheduleHistory: comprehensive audit trail with timestamps and state changes
  - RescheduleStatus: enum values (requested, approved, rejected, completed, cancelled)
- Database design considerations:
  - Proper indexing for efficient queries
  - Foreign key relationships to appointments and patients
  - Timestamp fields for tracking request lifecycle
  - Soft delete capability for data integrity
- Data validation implementation:
  - Business rule validation (minimum advance notice, availability windows)
  - Data type and format validation
  - Referential integrity checks
- HIPAA compliance requirements:
  - Encrypted sensitive data fields
  - Proper access control attributes
  - Audit logging capabilities

## Dependencies
- Core appointment booking data models
- Database migration framework
- Data validation framework

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Model design and implementation: 4-6 hours
- Database schema and migrations: 3-4 hours
- Validation rules and testing: 3-4 hours
- Documentation and review: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- All rescheduling data models implemented and tested
- Database migrations created and tested
- Data validation rules implemented and verified
- Model relationships properly defined and tested
- HIPAA compliance requirements satisfied
- Code review completed and approved

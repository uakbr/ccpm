# Create circuit breaker implementation

## Description
Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures and provide fast failure detection when external dependencies or internal services are experiencing issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Three-state circuit breaker (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
- [ ] Configurable failure thresholds and timeout periods
- [ ] Health check mechanism for service recovery detection
- [ ] Fast failure responses during open circuit state
- [ ] Circuit state change notifications and alerting
- [ ] Per-service and per-operation circuit configuration

## Technical Details
- Circuit breaker state machine:
  - Closed state: Normal operation with failure tracking
  - Open state: Fast failure with immediate rejection
  - Half-open state: Limited testing for service recovery
  - State transition logic based on success/failure rates
- Failure detection mechanisms:
  - Exception-based failure detection
  - Response time threshold monitoring
  - HTTP status code-based failure identification
  - Custom health check integration
- Configuration and tuning:
  - Failure rate thresholds (percentage and count-based)
  - Recovery timeout periods for state transitions
  - Request volume thresholds for statistical significance
  - Service-specific circuit breaker configurations
- Health check and recovery:
  - Periodic health check requests during open state
  - Gradual traffic increase during half-open state
  - Automatic recovery detection and circuit closing
  - Manual circuit override for emergency situations
- Integration with retry logic:
  - Circuit state consideration in retry decisions
  - Retry exhaustion triggering circuit opening
  - Coordinated backoff strategies across patterns
  - Fallback mechanism activation on circuit open

## Dependencies
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (085)
- Service health monitoring infrastructure
- Configuration management system
- Alerting and notification system

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Circuit breaker state machine: 6-8 hours
- Health check and recovery logic: 4-6 hours
- Configuration and tuning system: 3-4 hours
- Integration and monitoring: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures effectively
- Three-state operation functions correctly
- Configurable thresholds adapt to different services
- Health check mechanism detects service recovery
- Integration with retry logic optimizes failure handling
- Monitoring and alerting provide operational visibility

# Implement booking retry mechanism

## Description
Create intelligent retry mechanism for failed appointment bookings that handles transient failures, system outages, and booking conflicts with appropriate backoff strategies and user communication.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- [ ] Intelligent failure classification and retry decision logic
- [ ] User notification and status updates during retry attempts
- [ ] Manual retry options with alternative slot suggestions
- [ ] Retry analytics and failure pattern analysis
- [ ] Integration with voice interface for seamless user experience

## Technical Details
- Implement retry strategies:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
  - Immediate retry for temporary network issues
  - Delayed retry for system overload scenarios
  - No retry for permanent failures (invalid data, authorization)
- Develop failure classification:
  - Network connectivity issues
  - System temporary unavailability
  - Database lock timeouts
  - Booking conflicts and race conditions
- Create user communication:
  - Real-time status updates during retry attempts
  - Clear explanation of retry reasons and progress
  - Alternative option presentation during retry delays
  - Graceful failure communication with next steps
- Implement monitoring and analytics:
  - Retry success/failure rate tracking
  - Failure pattern identification
  - System reliability improvement recommendations
  - User experience impact measurement

## Dependencies
- Idempotent booking logic (061)
- Error classification and handling systems
- User notification infrastructure
- System monitoring and alerting

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Retry mechanism implementation: 4-6 hours
- Failure classification: 2-3 hours
- User communication: 2-3 hours
- Analytics and monitoring: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Booking failures are automatically retried with appropriate strategies
- Users receive clear communication during retry processes
- Retry mechanism improves overall booking success rates
- Failure analytics provide insights for system improvements
- Voice interface maintains natural conversation flow during retries
- System gracefully handles both temporary and permanent failures

# Implement appointment retrieval logic

## Description
Create robust logic to retrieve existing appointments for rescheduling, including patient verification, appointment validation, and security checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Appointment lookup by multiple identifiers (ID, phone, name)
- [ ] Patient verification and authorization checks
- [ ] Appointment eligibility validation for rescheduling
- [ ] Real-time availability checking
- [ ] Error handling for not found or invalid appointments
- [ ] Performance optimization for quick retrieval

## Technical Details
- Implement appointment retrieval services:
  - Multi-field search capability (appointment ID, patient phone, name + DOB)
  - Fuzzy matching for patient name variations
  - Date range filtering for recent/upcoming appointments
  - Provider-specific appointment filtering
- Security and authorization:
  - Patient identity verification through multiple data points
  - HIPAA-compliant access logging
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - Session-based authorization for appointment access
- Appointment eligibility checks:
  - Minimum advance notice requirements
  - Appointment status validation (only confirmed appointments)
  - Provider availability window validation
  - Insurance authorization status verification
- Performance optimization:
  - Database query optimization with proper indexing
  - Caching layer for frequently accessed appointments
  - Efficient data loading with lazy loading patterns
  - Response time monitoring and alerting

## Dependencies
- Rescheduling data models (072)
- Patient authentication system
- Appointment booking database
- Caching infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Core retrieval logic: 6-8 hours
- Security and verification: 4-6 hours
- Performance optimization: 3-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Appointment retrieval works with multiple search criteria
- Patient verification and security checks implemented
- Appointment eligibility validation functional
- Performance meets response time requirements (<500ms)
- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Security audit completed and approved

# Implement error handling tests

## Description
Create comprehensive testing suite for all error handling mechanisms, including failure injection, resilience pattern validation, recovery testing, and chaos engineering scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all error handling components
- [ ] Integration tests for error propagation and handling
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests for system resilience
- [ ] Performance tests under error conditions
- [ ] Recovery time measurement and validation
- [ ] End-to-end error scenario testing

## Technical Details
- Unit testing coverage:
  - Error classification accuracy and consistency
  - Retry logic with various backoff strategies
  - Circuit breaker state transitions and behavior
  - Timeout handling and resource cleanup
  - Fallback mechanism activation and switching
- Integration testing scenarios:
  - End-to-end error propagation through service layers
  - Cross-service error handling and coordination
  - External system failure simulation and handling
  - Database failure and recovery testing
  - Network partition and timeout scenario testing
- Chaos engineering implementation:
  - Service failure injection during peak loads
  - Network latency and packet loss simulation
  - Resource exhaustion scenarios (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Database corruption and recovery validation
  - Multi-region failure scenarios and fallback testing
- Performance testing under error conditions:
  - System behavior during high error rates
  - Resource utilization during error handling
  - Recovery time measurement and optimization
  - Error handling overhead impact on normal operations
  - Scalability testing with error injection
- Recovery and resilience validation:
  - Automatic recovery mechanism verification
  - Data consistency validation after recovery
  - Service restoration time measurement
  - Fallback system performance validation
  - End-to-end workflow completion after errors

## Dependencies
- All error handling components (084-092)
- Chaos engineering tools and framework
- Performance testing infrastructure
- Test automation and CI/CD pipeline

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Unit and integration tests: 10-12 hours
- Chaos engineering scenarios: 6-8 hours
- Performance and resilience tests: 4-6 hours
- Test automation and reporting: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) for error handling components
- Chaos engineering validates system resilience under adverse conditions
- Performance tests confirm error handling doesn't degrade system performance
- Recovery tests validate automatic and manual recovery mechanisms
- End-to-end tests confirm complete workflow resilience
- Test automation provides continuous validation of error handling capabilities

# Create appointment slot caching

## Description
Implement intelligent caching system for appointment slots to improve availability search performance, reduce database load, and provide faster response times for appointment booking through voice interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-level caching for appointment availability data
- [ ] Real-time cache invalidation on booking changes
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-frequency availability queries
- [ ] Cache warming strategies for popular time slots
- [ ] Cache consistency across distributed systems
- [ ] Integration with booking workflow and conflict detection

## Technical Details
- Implement caching architecture:
  - Provider-specific availability caching
  - Date range and appointment type based cache segmentation
  - Memory and distributed cache layers
  - Cache partitioning for scalability
- Develop cache management:
  - Real-time invalidation on appointment bookings/cancellations
  - TTL-based expiration with smart refresh
  - Cache warming based on booking patterns
  - Memory management and eviction policies
- Create consistency mechanisms:
  - Optimistic locking for cached availability
  - Cache versioning and conflict resolution
  - Cross-system cache synchronization
  - Stale data detection and recovery
- Implement performance monitoring:
  - Cache hit/miss ratio tracking
  - Response time improvement measurement
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Cache efficiency analytics

## Dependencies
- Slot availability search (055)
- Distributed caching infrastructure
- Real-time messaging systems
- Performance monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Cache architecture implementation: 4-6 hours
- Invalidation and consistency: 3-4 hours
- Performance optimization: 2-3 hours
- Monitoring and analytics: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Appointment availability queries show significant performance improvement
- Cache invalidation maintains data consistency across bookings
- System scales effectively with increasing appointment volume
- Cache warming reduces cold start latency for popular slots
- Performance monitoring provides insights for optimization
- Integration with voice interface provides sub-second response times

# Implement patient search functionality

## Description
Develop robust patient search capabilities that allow efficient patient lookup using various identifiers and fuzzy matching for voice-based interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-field search supporting name, DOB, phone, MRN, and SSN
- [ ] Fuzzy matching for names with phonetic similarity
- [ ] Search result ranking and confidence scoring
- [ ] Privacy-compliant search with minimal information disclosure
- [ ] Voice-optimized search handling speech recognition variations
- [ ] Performance optimization for large patient databases

## Technical Details
- Implement search algorithms:
  - Exact match search for unique identifiers
  - Fuzzy string matching for names (Soundex, Metaphone)
  - Date range searching for DOB approximations
  - Combined field searches with weighted scoring
- Develop voice-specific search features:
  - Phonetic name matching for speech input
  - Handling of common transcription errors
  - Multiple spelling variations support
- Create search optimization:
  - Database indexing for fast retrieval
  - Search result caching for common queries
  - Pagination for large result sets
- Implement privacy controls:
  - Minimum information required for search
  - Masked results before full verification
  - Access logging for all searches

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Database with proper indexing
- Fuzzy matching libraries
- Speech-to-text integration for voice searches

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Search algorithm implementation: 4-6 hours
- Fuzzy matching integration: 2-4 hours
- Performance optimization: 2-3 hours
- Privacy and security controls: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient search works reliably with various input combinations
- Fuzzy matching improves search success rate for voice input
- Search performance meets speed requirements (<500ms for typical queries)
- Privacy controls limit information exposure appropriately
- Search functionality handles edge cases and invalid input gracefully
- Comprehensive test coverage for all search scenarios

- [ ] Voice-optimized time presentation (avoiding ambiguity)
- [ ] Contextual grouping and organization of time slots
- [ ] Clear pronunciation and spelling of dates and times
- [ ] Multiple presentation formats for different scenarios
- [ ] Integration with text-to-speech optimization

## Technical Details
- Implement natural language formatting:
  - Conversational time descriptions ("tomorrow morning", "next Tuesday")
  - Relative time references with clear date anchoring
  - Time range grouping (morning, afternoon, evening slots)
  - User-friendly date formatting with day of week

  - Phonetic-friendly number pronunciation
  - Clear enunciation patterns for dates
  - Pause and phrasing optimization for TTS
- Create contextual presentation:

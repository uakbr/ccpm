# Implement idempotent booking logic

## Description
Create idempotent booking operations that prevent duplicate appointments, handle retry scenarios gracefully, and ensure consistent booking state even in the face of network issues or system failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Duplicate booking prevention with idempotency keys
- [ ] Retry-safe booking operations
- [ ] Consistent booking state across system failures
- [ ] Graceful handling of concurrent booking requests
- [ ] Booking state recovery and reconciliation
- [ ] Integration with existing booking workflows

## Technical Details
- Implement idempotency mechanisms:
  - Unique idempotency key generation and validation
  - Duplicate request detection and response
  - Request deduplication within time windows
  - State consistency across multiple operations
- Develop retry handling:
  - Exponential backoff for failed operations
  - Partial booking state recovery
  - Transaction rollback and cleanup
  - Client-side retry coordination
- Create concurrent booking protection:
  - Optimistic locking for appointment slots
  - Race condition detection and resolution
  - Fair queuing for high-demand time slots
  - Deadlock prevention and recovery
- Implement state reconciliation:
  - Periodic state consistency checks
  - Orphaned booking detection and cleanup
  - Cross-system state synchronization
  - Audit trail for booking state changes

## Dependencies
- Appointment booking API (059)
- Database transaction management
- Distributed system coordination
- Message queuing infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Idempotency implementation: 6-8 hours
- Retry and recovery logic: 6-8 hours
- Concurrency protection: 4-6 hours
- State reconciliation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Booking operations are fully idempotent and safe to retry
- Duplicate bookings are prevented even under adverse conditions
- System maintains consistent state during failures
- Concurrent booking requests are handled fairly and safely
- Recovery mechanisms restore system to consistent state
- Performance impact of idempotency measures is minimal

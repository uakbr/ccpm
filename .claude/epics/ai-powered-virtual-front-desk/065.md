# Implement date/time normalization

## Description
Create robust date and time normalization system that converts various natural language date/time expressions into standardized formats for accurate appointment scheduling through voice interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Natural language date/time parsing and conversion
- [ ] Multiple date/time format support and standardization
- [ ] Relative date/time expression handling
- [ ] Ambiguity resolution with contextual clarification
- [ ] Time zone awareness and conversion
- [ ] Integration with voice recognition error correction

## Technical Details
- Implement natural language parsing:
  - Relative expressions ("tomorrow", "next week", "in three days")
  - Specific date formats (spoken and written variations)
  - Time expressions with various formats (12/24 hour)
  - Combined date/time expressions
- Develop normalization algorithms:
  - Standard ISO format conversion
  - Time zone detection and conversion
  - Business hours and availability alignment
  - Date/time validation and bounds checking
- Create ambiguity resolution:
  - Context-aware interpretation (morning/afternoon clarification)
  - Confirmation prompts for unclear expressions
  - Default assumption handling with user feedback
  - Multiple interpretation presentation
- Implement voice-specific features:
  - Transcription error correction for dates/times
  - Phonetic number recognition and validation
  - Spelling confirmation for unclear dates
  - Natural conversation flow for clarification

## Dependencies
- Time slot presentation formatter (058)
- Natural language processing libraries
- Time zone and calendar services
- Voice transcription error patterns

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Natural language parsing: 4-6 hours
- Normalization algorithms: 3-4 hours
- Ambiguity resolution: 2-3 hours
- Voice integration: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- System accurately parses common date/time expressions from voice input
- Normalization produces consistent, standardized date/time values
- Ambiguous expressions are resolved through appropriate clarification
- Time zone handling works correctly for multi-location practices
- Voice-specific error correction improves transcription accuracy
- Integration with booking workflow provides seamless user experience

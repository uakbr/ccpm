# Create appointment update API integration

## Description
Integrate with external appointment management systems and provider calendars to synchronize rescheduled appointments across all platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Provider calendar system API integration
- [ ] Electronic health record (EHR) system updates
- [ ] Practice management system synchronization
- [ ] Real-time bi-directional sync capability
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- [ ] Retry logic for failed API calls

## Technical Details
- Multi-system integration architecture:
  - Adapter pattern for different provider systems (Epic, Cerner, AllScripts)
  - Unified interface for appointment operations across systems
  - Message queue for reliable asynchronous processing
  - Event-driven architecture for real-time synchronization
- API integration implementation:
  - RESTful API clients with authentication and rate limiting
  - FHIR standard compliance for healthcare interoperability
  - Webhook handling for incoming updates from external systems
  - Batch processing capability for bulk appointment updates
- Conflict resolution strategies:
  - Last-writer-wins with conflict detection
  - Three-way merge for concurrent modifications
  - Manual review queue for complex conflicts
  - Automated rollback for failed synchronizations
- Error handling and resilience:
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failing external systems
  - Exponential backoff retry logic with jitter
  - Dead letter queue for permanently failed messages
  - Monitoring and alerting for integration health
- Data transformation and mapping:
  - Field mapping between different system schemas
  - Data validation and sanitization for external APIs
  - Time zone conversion and standardization
  - Custom field handling for provider-specific requirements

## Dependencies
- Appointment modification flow (074)
- Reschedule validation rules (075)
- Message queue infrastructure
- External system API credentials

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- API client implementation: 8-10 hours
- Conflict resolution logic: 6-8 hours
- Error handling and resilience: 4-6 hours
- Testing and integration: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- All target external systems integrated successfully
- Bi-directional synchronization working reliably
- Conflict resolution handles concurrent updates
- Error handling ensures system resilience
- Performance meets throughput requirements
- Monitoring and alerting operational

## Description
Create comprehensive deployment validation tests to automatically verify system functionality and performance after each deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create post-deployment smoke tests for critical functionality
- [ ] Implement deployment health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Create performance validation tests for deployment acceptance
- [ ] Implement security validation tests post-deployment
- [ ] Create deployment validation reporting and alerting

## Technical Details
- Implement synthetic transaction monitoring for critical user journeys
- Create automated API health checks and response validation
- Set up database connectivity and performance validation
- Implement security scanning and vulnerability checks post-deployment
- Create validation test scheduling and execution automation

## Dependencies
- Feature flag system must be implemented
- Test automation framework must be available

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Deployment validation tests operational for all critical functions
- Automated validation prevents promotion of failed deployments
- Validation test results integrated into deployment pipeline
- Validation failures trigger appropriate alerts and procedures
- Validation test documentation and maintenance procedures established

# Implement confidence scoring system

## Description
Develop a confidence scoring system that evaluates the reliability of speech recognition results and determines when to request clarification from users or trigger reprompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Confidence score calculation implemented for ASR results
- [ ] Threshold-based decision logic for accepting/rejecting speech input
- [ ] Integration with reprompt system for low-confidence results
- [ ] Confidence score logging and analytics
- [ ] Adaptive threshold adjustment based on user feedback
- [ ] Multi-factor confidence assessment (acoustic, language model, context)

## Technical Details
- Implement confidence score aggregation from ASR providers
- Develop custom confidence metrics based on:
  - Acoustic model confidence
  - Language model probability
  - Contextual appropriateness
  - Word-level confidence aggregation
- Create threshold configuration system
- Implement confidence score normalization across different ASR providers
- Set up feedback loop for threshold optimization
- Add confidence score to response metadata

## Dependencies
- ASR speech models (031)
- Speech input processing pipeline
- User interaction flow design

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Algorithm development: 4-6 hours
- Integration with ASR: 2-4 hours
- Threshold optimization: 2-3 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Confidence scoring algorithm is implemented and tested
- Thresholds are configured and optimized for the use case
- System correctly identifies low-confidence speech input
- Confidence scores are logged for analysis and improvement
- Integration with downstream systems (reprompt, validation) is complete

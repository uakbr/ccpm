# Implement conflict resolution for reschedules

## Description
Build intelligent conflict resolution system to handle scheduling conflicts, double-bookings, and resource contention during the rescheduling process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic conflict detection across all scheduling systems
- [ ] Intelligent alternative slot suggestion engine
- [ ] Manual override capability for authorized users
- [ ] Conflict escalation workflow
- [ ] Resource optimization algorithms
- [ ] Patient preference consideration in resolution

## Technical Details
- Conflict detection engine:
  - Real-time conflict scanning across multiple calendar systems
  - Resource availability checking (rooms, equipment, staff)
  - Patient scheduling preference validation
  - Provider capacity and workload analysis
- Alternative suggestion algorithms:
  - Machine learning-based slot recommendation
  - Patient preference matching (time, day, provider)
  - Travel time and location optimization
  - Insurance and authorization compatibility checking
- Automated resolution strategies:
  - Priority-based conflict resolution (emergency vs routine)
  - Resource reallocation and optimization
  - Provider substitution with patient approval
  - Appointment type modification suggestions
- Manual intervention framework:
  - Escalation triggers and notification system
  - Administrative override with approval workflows
  - Conflict review dashboard for scheduling staff
  - Audit trail for all manual interventions
- Optimization algorithms:
  - Schedule density optimization to reduce gaps
  - Provider utilization balancing
  - Patient journey optimization (multiple appointments)
  - Cancellation prediction and proactive rebooking

## Dependencies
- Appointment update API integration (076)
- Provider calendar systems
- Machine learning infrastructure
- Administrative workflow system

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Conflict detection engine: 8-10 hours
- Alternative suggestion algorithms: 6-8 hours
- Manual intervention framework: 4-6 hours
- Optimization algorithms: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- Conflicts detected automatically across all systems
- Intelligent alternative suggestions provided
- Manual override process functional and auditable
- Escalation workflow operates smoothly
- Optimization algorithms improve scheduling efficiency
- System reduces scheduling conflicts by measurable percentage

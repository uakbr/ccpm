# Implement alerting rules

## Description
Create comprehensive alerting system with intelligent rules, escalation procedures, and multi-channel notifications to ensure rapid response to system issues and anomalies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Threshold-based alerting for critical metrics
- [ ] Anomaly detection with machine learning-based alerts
- [ ] Escalation procedures with time-based escalation
- [ ] Multi-channel notification delivery (email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty)
- [ ] Alert suppression and correlation to reduce noise
- [ ] On-call rotation and scheduling integration

## Technical Details
- Threshold-based alerting rules:
  - Critical system metrics (CPU > 90%, memory > 95%, disk > 90%)
  - Application performance thresholds (response time > 5s, error rate > 5%)
  - Business metric alerts (booking success rate < 85%, call abandonment > 15%)
  - Infrastructure alerts (database connections, queue depths, service health)
- Anomaly detection and intelligent alerting:
  - Machine learning-based anomaly detection for unusual patterns
  - Seasonal trend consideration for baseline establishment
  - Multi-variate anomaly detection across correlated metrics
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical patterns
- Alert escalation and routing:
  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary escalation tiers
  - Time-based escalation with configurable delays
  - Skill-based routing for specialized issues
  - Business hours vs. after-hours escalation procedures
- Multi-channel notification system:
  - Email notifications with detailed context and runbooks
  - SMS alerts for critical issues requiring immediate attention
  - Slack integration for team collaboration and updates
  - PagerDuty integration for on-call management and tracking
- Alert correlation and suppression:
  - Related alert grouping to prevent notification storms
  - Root cause analysis to suppress downstream alerts
  - Alert frequency limiting and rate control
  - Maintenance mode for planned downtime alert suppression
- On-call management integration:
  - Rotation scheduling with automatic failover
  - Skill-based on-call assignments for specialized alerts
  - Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
  - Escalation to backup personnel for unacknowledged alerts

## Dependencies
- Performance monitoring (103)
- Machine learning platform for anomaly detection
- Multi-channel notification infrastructure
- On-call management system (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Threshold and anomaly detection rules: 6-8 hours
- Escalation and routing logic: 4-6 hours
- Multi-channel notification system: 3-4 hours
- Alert correlation and on-call integration: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Alerting rules provide comprehensive coverage of system health
- Anomaly detection identifies issues before they impact patients
- Escalation procedures ensure appropriate response to critical issues
- Multi-channel notifications reach the right people at the right time
- Alert correlation reduces noise and improves signal-to-noise ratio
- On-call integration ensures 24/7 system monitoring and response

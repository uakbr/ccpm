# Implement basic TwiML response handler

## Description
Develop a robust TwiML response handler that generates appropriate XML responses for voice interactions. This handler will serve as the foundation for all voice prompts and call flow logic in the virtual front desk system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TwiML XML generation library integrated
- [ ] Basic voice prompts implemented (greeting, menu options)
- [ ] Input collection mechanisms configured (speech, DTMF)
- [ ] Call flow state management implemented
- [ ] Dynamic TwiML generation based on context
- [ ] Voice prompt customization capability
- [ ] Response validation and error correction
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of TwiML responses

## Technical Details
- **Library**: Twilio SDK for TwiML generation
- **Verbs**: Say, Gather, Redirect, Record, Transfer
- **Voice Options**: Language, voice type, speech rate
- **State Management**: Session-based or stateless design
- **Validation**: XML schema validation for responses
- **Logging**: Track all generated TwiML for debugging

## Dependencies
- Task 010 (Voice webhook endpoints for TwiML delivery)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- TwiML handler development: 4-6 hours
- Voice prompt implementation: 3-4 hours
- State management logic: 3-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-2 hours

## Definition of Done
- TwiML handler generates valid XML responses
- Basic voice prompts play correctly during calls
- Input collection works for both speech and DTMF
- State is properly maintained across call interactions
- Response generation is logged and monitorable
- System handles various call scenarios gracefully

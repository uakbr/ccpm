# Create patient management testing suite

## Description
Develop a comprehensive testing suite for all patient management components, including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and compliance validation to ensure robust patient data handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all patient management components
- [ ] Integration tests for patient workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for patient operations
- [ ] HIPAA compliance validation tests
- [ ] Data integrity and validation tests
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details
- Implement comprehensive test coverage:
  - Unit tests for data models, validation, search, and caching
  - Integration tests for registration, verification, and lookup workflows
  - End-to-end tests for complete patient management scenarios
  - Performance tests for database operations and search functionality
- Develop test data management:
  - Synthetic patient data generation for testing
  - HIPAA-compliant test data handling
  - Test data cleanup and isolation
  - Edge case and boundary condition testing
- Create compliance testing:
  - HIPAA privacy rule validation
  - Data security requirement verification
  - Access control and audit logging tests
  - Data retention and disposal validation
- Implement automated testing infrastructure:
  - CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Test result reporting and analytics
  - Performance regression detection
  - Security vulnerability scanning

## Dependencies
- All patient management components (039-052)
- Test framework infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- HIPAA compliance requirements

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Test framework setup: 4-6 hours
- Unit and integration tests: 12-16 hours
- Performance and compliance tests: 4-6 hours
- CI/CD integration: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test suite covers all patient management functionality
- Tests validate HIPAA compliance and data security requirements
- Automated tests run in CI/CD with quality gates
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements (>85%)
- Performance tests validate scalability requirements
- Test data management ensures privacy and compliance

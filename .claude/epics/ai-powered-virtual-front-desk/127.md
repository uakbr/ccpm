## Description
Implement comprehensive regression test suite to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality and maintain system stability across releases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create comprehensive regression test scenarios
- [ ] Implement automated regression test execution
- [ ] Establish regression test baseline and maintenance procedures
- [ ] Create test prioritization based on risk and impact
- [ ] Implement regression test reporting and trend analysis

## Technical Details
- Combine unit, integration, and E2E tests into regression suite
- Implement test selection based on code changes
- Create smoke tests for rapid feedback
- Set up parallel test execution for faster results
- Implement test result comparison and anomaly detection

## Dependencies
- Unit, integration, and E2E test suites must be operational
- CI/CD pipeline must be established

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Regression test suite covers all critical functionality
- Automated execution prevents deployment of broken code
- Test prioritization optimizes execution time
- Regression test trends tracked and analyzed
- Test maintenance procedures documented

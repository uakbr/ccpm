# Create slot collection mechanism

## Description
Implement a slot collection mechanism that can gather, validate, and store user information during conversation flow. This system will handle different data types, validation rules, and confirmation workflows for appointment scheduling data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Typed slot definitions (string, number, date, phone, email)
- [ ] Input validation and formatting
- [ ] Confirmation and correction workflows
- [ ] Multi-turn data collection support
- [ ] Slot dependency and relationship handling
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Integration with speech recognition and DTMF
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

## Technical Details
- **Data Types**: String, number, date/time, phone, email, choice
- **Validation**: Format checking, range validation, business rules
- **Collection**: Single-turn and multi-turn collection strategies
- **Confirmation**: Read-back and confirmation workflows
- **Storage**: Secure, temporary storage during conversation
- **Integration**: Work with speech and DTMF input systems

## Dependencies
- Task 023 (State machine for slot collection flow)
- Task 024 (Condition evaluator for validation rules)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: L (16-24 hours)
- Slot definition and validation system: 6-8 hours
- Collection workflow implementation: 4-6 hours
- Confirmation and correction logic: 3-4 hours
- Integration and testing: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Slot collection handles all required data types
- Input validation prevents invalid data collection
- Confirmation workflows ensure data accuracy
- Multi-turn collection manages complex data gathering
- Slot dependencies are properly managed
- Integration with input systems works seamlessly

## Description
Implement comprehensive audit trail system to log all system activities, user interactions, and data access events for compliance and security monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Log all user authentication and authorization events
- [ ] Track all PHI access and modification activities
- [ ] Implement system configuration change logging
- [ ] Create tamper-evident audit log storage
- [ ] Establish audit log analysis and alerting

## Technical Details
- Use structured logging format (JSON) for all audit events
- Implement centralized log aggregation with ELK Stack or equivalent
- Create immutable audit log storage with cryptographic hashing
- Implement log retention policies per regulatory requirements
- Set up automated anomaly detection for audit events

## Dependencies
- Data encryption must be implemented for log protection
- Centralized logging infrastructure required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Audit trail system captures all required events
- Logs are tamper-evident and securely stored
- Audit log analysis tools operational
- Automated alerting configured for suspicious activities
- Audit trail tested and validated for completeness

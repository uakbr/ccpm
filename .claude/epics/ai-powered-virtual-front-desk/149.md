## Description
Implement gradual rollout strategy including canary deployments, traffic splitting, and automated rollback based on success metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement canary deployment infrastructure
- [ ] Create traffic splitting and routing mechanisms
- [ ] Establish success metrics and automated decision making
- [ ] Implement automated rollback based on failure criteria
- [ ] Create gradual rollout monitoring and reporting

## Technical Details
- Configure service mesh or load balancer for traffic splitting
- Implement metrics collection for deployment success evaluation
- Create automated rollback triggers based on error rates and performance
- Set up canary analysis with statistical significance testing
- Implement rollout progression automation based on success criteria

## Dependencies
- Deployment validation tests must be operational
- Monitoring and metrics collection required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Canary deployment infrastructure operational
- Traffic splitting validated and controllable
- Automated rollback triggers functional and tested
- Gradual rollout progression automated
- Rollout strategy documented and team trained

# Configure NexHealth API credentials

## Description
Set up NexHealth API integration credentials and configure the connection for practice management system integration. This enables the virtual front desk to access appointment scheduling, patient data, and provider information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NexHealth API account created or accessed
- [ ] API credentials (client ID, secret) obtained
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow configured for secure authentication
- [ ] Test API calls successful (practices, providers, appointments)
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling configured
- [ ] Credentials securely stored in credential management system

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: NexHealth Practice Management API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens
- **Scope**: Appointments, providers, patients (read/write)
- **Rate Limits**: Respect API quotas and implement backoff strategies
- **Environment**: Configure for development, staging, and production

## Dependencies
- None (can be done in parallel with other setup tasks)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: S (4-8 hours)
- API account setup: 1-2 hours
- OAuth configuration: 2-3 hours
- Test integration development: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done
- NexHealth API credentials are configured and tested
- OAuth flow is working correctly
- Basic API operations (read practices, providers) are functional
- Credentials are securely managed
- Integration is documented with examples

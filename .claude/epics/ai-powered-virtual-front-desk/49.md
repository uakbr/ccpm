# Implement patient data sanitization

## Description
Develop comprehensive data sanitization processes to clean, standardize, and protect patient information while maintaining data integrity and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Input sanitization for all patient data fields
- [ ] Data standardization and normalization
- [ ] Sensitive data masking and protection
- [ ] Injection attack prevention
- [ ] Data format standardization
- [ ] Sanitization logging and monitoring

## Technical Details
- Implement input sanitization:
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS attack mitigation
  - Command injection protection
  - Path traversal prevention
- Develop data standardization:
  - Name standardization (proper case, special characters)
  - Address standardization and validation
  - Phone number formatting and normalization
  - Date format standardization
- Create sensitive data protection:
  - SSN masking and encryption
  - Credit card information protection
  - PII data redaction for logging
  - Secure data transmission
- Implement data quality improvement:
  - Duplicate whitespace removal
  - Special character handling
  - Encoding normalization
  - Data consistency validation

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient data validation (044)
- Security frameworks
- Data standardization libraries

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Input sanitization implementation: 4-6 hours
- Data standardization: 3-4 hours
- Sensitive data protection: 3-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- All patient data input is properly sanitized
- Sensitive information is protected and masked appropriately
- Data standardization improves data quality and consistency
- Security vulnerabilities are mitigated
- Sanitization processes are logged and monitored
- Performance impact of sanitization is minimized

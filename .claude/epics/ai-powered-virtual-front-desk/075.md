# Implement reschedule validation rules

## Description
Create comprehensive validation rules to ensure rescheduling requests comply with business rules, provider policies, and regulatory requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Minimum advance notice validation
- [ ] Maximum reschedule frequency limits

- [ ] Insurance authorization validation
- [ ] Business hours and blackout period checks
- [ ] Patient eligibility verification

## Technical Details
- Business rule validation engine:
  - Configurable validation rules with priority ordering
  - Rule engine that supports complex conditional logic
  - Custom validation messages for different rule violations
  - Rule versioning and audit trail for changes
- Advance notice requirements:
  - Minimum hours before appointment (configurable by provider/type)
  - Emergency exception handling for urgent reschedules
  - Business day calculation excluding holidays and weekends
  - Time zone handling for multi-location providers
- Frequency and limit validations:
  - Maximum reschedules per appointment (prevent abuse)
  - Monthly/yearly reschedule limits per patient
  - Cooling-off periods between reschedule attempts
  - Provider capacity protection rules
- Schedule constraint validation:

- Insurance validation services

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Rule engine implementation: 6-8 hours
- Business rule configuration: 4-6 hours
- Insurance validation integration: 3-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- All validation rules implemented and configurable
- Rule engine handles complex conditional logic
- Insurance and authorization validation functional
- Comprehensive error messages for rule violations
- Performance meets response time requirements
- Rule changes can be made without code deployment

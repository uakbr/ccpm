## Description
Create comprehensive integration test suite to validate interactions between system components, external services, and data persistence layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create API integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test database integration with real database instances
- [ ] Validate external service integrations (AI services, payment processing)
- [ ] Implement test data management and cleanup
- [ ] Create service-to-service communication tests

## Technical Details
- Use Testcontainers for isolated database testing
- Implement contract testing with external services
- Create test scenarios for happy path and error conditions
- Set up test environment with docker-compose
- Implement parallel test execution with test isolation

## Dependencies
- Unit test framework must be established
- Development database environment required

## Effort Estimate
L (16-24 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Integration tests cover all critical system interactions
- Test environment provisions and cleans up automatically
- External service integrations validated with contract tests
- Test suite runs reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- Integration test documentation created for maintenance

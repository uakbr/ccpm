# Create decision tree configuration loader

## Description
Develop a configuration management system for loading, updating, and managing decision trees in production. This system will support hot-reloading, version control, rollback capabilities, and multi-environment tree management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Decision tree loading from various sources (files, databases, APIs)
- [ ] Hot-reload capability without system downtime
- [ ] Version control and change tracking for trees
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for problematic tree updates
- [ ] Environment-specific tree configurations
- [ ] Configuration validation before deployment
- [ ] Audit logging for tree changes
- [ ] Integration with deployment pipelines

## Technical Details
- **Sources**: File system, database, configuration management systems
- **Hot-reload**: Live updates without service interruption
- **Versioning**: Track changes, maintain history
- **Rollback**: Quick reversion to previous working versions
- **Environments**: Development, staging, production configurations
- **Validation**: Pre-deployment validation using tree validator

## Dependencies
- Task 022 (Tree parser for configuration processing)
- Task 027 (Tree validator for pre-deployment validation)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Configuration loader development: 4-5 hours
- Hot-reload mechanism: 3-4 hours
- Version control and rollback: 2-3 hours
- Environment management and testing: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Configuration loader supports multiple tree sources
- Hot-reload updates trees without system downtime
- Version control tracks all tree changes
- Rollback quickly reverts to previous configurations
- Environment-specific configurations work correctly
- Validation prevents deployment of invalid trees

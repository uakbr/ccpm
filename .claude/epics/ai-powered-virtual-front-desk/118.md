## Description
Establish comprehensive unit test framework with testing utilities, mocking capabilities, and coverage reporting for all application components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework (Jest, pytest, or equivalent)
- [ ] Create test utilities and helper functions
- [ ] Implement mocking libraries for external dependencies
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting with 80% minimum threshold
- [ ] Create unit test templates and best practices

## Technical Details
- Configure Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript components
- Set up pytest for Python backend services
- Implement test fixtures and factories
- Create mock services for external APIs
- Configure parallel test execution for faster feedback

## Dependencies
- Development environment must be set up
- Application architecture must be defined

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Unit test framework operational for all components
- Code coverage reporting configured and meeting thresholds
- Test utilities and mocks available for all external dependencies
- Developer documentation created for writing tests
- CI/CD integration validates unit test execution

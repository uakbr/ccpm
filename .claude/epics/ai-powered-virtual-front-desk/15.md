# Implement call logging infrastructure

## Description
Develop comprehensive call logging infrastructure to track all telephony interactions for the virtual front desk system. This includes call metadata, conversation flows, outcomes, and performance metrics while ensuring HIPAA compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Call session tracking from start to finish
- [ ] Conversation flow and decision point logging
- [ ] Caller information and interaction history
- [ ] Call outcome and resolution tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics collection (duration, success rate)
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant data storage and retention
- [ ] Searchable call logs with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

## Technical Details
- **Storage**: Encrypted database with proper indexing
- **Schema**: Call sessions, interactions, outcomes
- **Retention**: HIPAA-compliant data lifecycle management
- **Performance**: Efficient querying and reporting
- **Privacy**: PHI protection and access controls
- **Integration**: Connect with monitoring infrastructure

## Dependencies
- Task 005 (Monitoring infrastructure for integration)
- Task 010 (Voice webhooks generating log events)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Database schema design: 3-4 hours
- Logging service implementation: 4-6 hours
- HIPAA compliance features: 3-4 hours
- Testing and performance validation: 2-2 hours

## Definition of Done
- All call interactions are logged comprehensively
- Call logs are searchable and filterable
- Data storage meets HIPAA compliance requirements
- Performance metrics are collected and available
- Integration with monitoring systems is functional
- Log retention policies are implemented and automated

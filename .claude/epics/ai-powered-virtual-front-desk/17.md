# Set up call transfer mechanism

## Description
Implement call transfer functionality to route callers to appropriate staff members when the virtual front desk cannot handle their request or when human intervention is required. This includes warm and cold transfer options with proper call logging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cold transfer implementation (direct routing)
- [ ] Warm transfer capability (introduction before transfer)
- [ ] Staff availability checking before transfer
- [ ] Transfer destination configuration management
- [ ] Call context preservation during transfer
- [ ] Transfer attempt logging and monitoring
- [ ] Fallback handling for failed transfers
- [ ] Integration with practice staff directory

## Technical Details
- **Transfer Types**: Cold (immediate) and warm (with introduction)
- **Destinations**: Staff phone numbers, department lines
- **Availability**: Real-time staff status checking
- **Context**: Preserve caller information and conversation history
- **Logging**: Track transfer attempts and success rates
- **Fallbacks**: Voicemail or callback options

## Dependencies
- Task 011 (TwiML handler for transfer verbs)
- Task 014 (Call logging for transfer tracking)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Transfer logic implementation: 4-5 hours
- Staff directory integration: 3-4 hours
- Context preservation system: 3-4 hours
- Testing and fallback handling: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Both cold and warm transfers function correctly
- Staff availability is checked before transfer attempts
- Call context is preserved and passed to receiving party
- Transfer failures are handled gracefully
- All transfer activities are logged appropriately
- Integration with staff directory provides accurate routing

# Set up barge-in functionality

## Description
Implement barge-in capability that allows users to interrupt system prompts and responses by speaking, enabling more natural conversational flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time voice activity detection during system speech output
- [ ] Immediate interruption of TTS playback when user speech is detected
- [ ] Smooth transition from system speech to user input recognition
- [ ] Configurable barge-in sensitivity and delay settings
- [ ] Prevention of false triggers from system audio feedback
- [ ] Integration with conversation flow management

## Technical Details
- Implement Voice Activity Detection (VAD):
  - Real-time audio monitoring during TTS playback
  - Energy-based and spectral-based detection algorithms
  - Noise floor adaptation and calibration
- Develop interrupt handling:
  - Immediate TTS stopping mechanisms
  - Audio buffer management and cleanup
  - Seamless transition to ASR listening mode
- Create barge-in configuration:
  - Sensitivity threshold adjustment
  - Minimum detection duration settings
  - Cooldown periods to prevent rapid toggling
- Implement echo cancellation to prevent feedback loops
- Add barge-in analytics and performance monitoring

## Dependencies
- ASR speech models (031)
- Text-to-speech system
- Audio input/output management
- Real-time audio processing capabilities

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- VAD implementation: 6-8 hours
- TTS interruption system: 4-6 hours
- Audio buffer management: 3-4 hours
- Testing and calibration: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Barge-in consistently detects user speech during system prompts
- TTS interruption is immediate and clean (no audio artifacts)
- False positive rate is minimized through proper calibration
- System transitions smoothly between speaking and listening modes
- Barge-in settings are configurable and documented
- Performance metrics show improved user experience

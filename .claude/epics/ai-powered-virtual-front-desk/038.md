# Create speech recognition testing suite

## Description
Develop a comprehensive testing suite for all speech recognition components, including automated tests, performance benchmarks, and regression testing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all speech recognition components
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end speech processing
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests with accuracy and latency metrics
- [ ] Regression test suite for model updates and configuration changes
- [ ] Test data management including diverse speech samples
- [ ] Continuous integration pipeline for automated testing

## Technical Details
- Implement test categories:
  - Unit tests for individual components (ASR, parser, confidence scoring)
  - Integration tests for complete speech workflows
  - Performance tests for accuracy and speed benchmarks
  - Load tests for concurrent speech processing
- Create test data management:
  - Curated speech sample library with ground truth
  - Synthetic speech generation for edge cases
  - Multi-accent and multi-demographic test sets
  - Privacy-compliant test data handling
- Develop automated testing infrastructure:
  - CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Automated test execution and reporting
  - Performance regression detection
  - Test result visualization and analytics

## Dependencies
- All speech recognition components (031-037)
- Test data collection and curation
- CI/CD infrastructure
- Performance monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Test framework setup: 4-6 hours
- Test case development: 8-10 hours
- Test data preparation: 3-4 hours
- CI/CD integration: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test suite covers all speech recognition functionality
- Automated tests run in CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- Performance benchmarks are established and monitored
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements (>80%)
- Test data is well-organized and maintainable
- Documentation explains testing procedures and expectations

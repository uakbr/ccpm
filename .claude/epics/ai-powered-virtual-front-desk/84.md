# Implement rescheduling flow tests

## Description
Create comprehensive testing suite for the complete rescheduling flow, including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and end-to-end workflow validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all rescheduling components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete rescheduling workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for high-volume rescheduling scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end tests with external system integration
- [ ] Error scenario and failure recovery tests
- [ ] Compliance and security testing

## Technical Details
- Unit testing coverage:
  - Data model validation and business logic
  - Appointment retrieval and validation logic
  - Reschedule validation rules and conflict detection
  - Notification and confirmation systems
  - Audit logging and history tracking
- Integration testing scenarios:
  - Complete reschedule workflow from request to confirmation
  - External system API integration testing
  - Multi-party notification coordination testing
  - Rollback mechanism validation
  - Cross-system data consistency verification
- Performance and load testing:
  - Concurrent rescheduling request handling
  - High-volume notification delivery testing
  - Database performance under heavy reschedule load
  - External API rate limiting and throttling
  - System resource utilization monitoring
- End-to-end workflow validation:
  - Patient-initiated reschedule scenarios
  - Administrative reschedule workflows
  - Emergency reschedule handling
  - Complex conflict resolution scenarios
  - Multi-step approval process testing
- Error and failure scenario testing:
  - Network failure and timeout handling
  - External system unavailability scenarios
  - Data corruption and recovery testing
  - Security breach simulation and response
  - HIPAA compliance violation detection

## Dependencies
- All rescheduling flow components (072-082)
- Test automation framework
- Performance testing tools
- External system test environments

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Unit and integration tests: 12-16 hours
- Performance and load tests: 6-8 hours
- End-to-end workflow tests: 4-6 hours
- Error and security tests: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) for all rescheduling components
- All integration tests pass with external systems
- Performance tests validate scalability requirements
- End-to-end tests cover all major workflow scenarios
- Error handling tests ensure system resilience
- Compliance tests verify HIPAA and security requirements

# Set up development environment

## Description
Configure local development environment with all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations for building the virtual front desk system. This includes runtime environments, development tools, and local testing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js/Python runtime environment installed and configured
- [ ] Package management (npm/pip) set up with project dependencies
- [ ] Local development server configured
- [ ] Environment variables and configuration files set up
- [ ] Local testing tools installed (unit test runners, mocking tools)
- [ ] Code editor/IDE configured with project-specific settings
- [ ] Local webhook testing tool configured (ngrok or similar)
- [ ] Database setup for local development

## Technical Details
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: Express.js, FastAPI, or similar
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for development
- **Testing**: Jest, pytest, or equivalent
- **Webhooks**: ngrok for local Twilio webhook testing
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config management

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Twilio account needed for webhook testing)
- Task 003 (Git repository for code checkout)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: S (4-8 hours)
- Runtime and tools installation: 2-3 hours
- Project configuration: 2-3 hours
- Testing and validation: 1-2 hours

## Definition of Done
- Development environment is fully functional
- All project dependencies are installed and working
- Local server can receive and respond to webhooks
- Tests can be run locally
- Development workflow is documented
- Environment can be replicated by other developers

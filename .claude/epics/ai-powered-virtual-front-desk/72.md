# Implement appointment booking tests

## Description
Create comprehensive testing suite for all appointment booking components, including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and end-to-end voice interaction testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all appointment booking components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete booking workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for high-volume booking scenarios
- [ ] Voice interaction testing with speech recognition
- [ ] Failure scenario and error handling tests
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details
- Implement comprehensive test coverage:
  - Unit tests for booking logic, validation, and data models
  - Integration tests for API endpoints and workflow orchestration
  - End-to-end tests for complete voice-to-booking scenarios
  - Performance tests for concurrent booking and system load
- Develop specialized test scenarios:
  - Voice recognition accuracy testing with various accents
  - Booking conflict detection and resolution testing
  - Retry mechanism and failure recovery testing
  - Multi-channel notification delivery testing
- Create test data management:
  - Realistic appointment and patient test data sets
  - Provider schedule and availability simulation
  - Booking pattern simulation for load testing
  - HIPAA-compliant test data handling
- Implement automated testing infrastructure:
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with quality gates
  - Automated test execution and result reporting
  - Performance regression detection and alerting
  - Test coverage monitoring and requirements

## Dependencies
- All appointment booking components (054-070)
- Test framework and automation infrastructure
- Voice simulation and testing tools
- Performance testing and monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Test framework setup: 4-6 hours
- Unit and integration tests: 12-16 hours
- Performance and voice testing: 6-8 hours
- CI/CD integration: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test suite covers all appointment booking functionality
- Automated tests run in CI/CD pipeline with appropriate quality gates
- Performance tests validate scalability requirements
- Voice interaction tests ensure accurate speech processing
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements (>85%)
- Testing infrastructure supports continuous quality assurance

# Implement slot availability search

## Description
Develop intelligent appointment slot availability search that finds optimal appointment times based on patient preferences, provider schedules, and scheduling constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-criteria availability search (provider, date range, appointment type)
- [ ] Intelligent slot ranking based on patient preferences
- [ ] Real-time availability checking with conflict detection
- [ ] Alternative slot suggestion when preferred times unavailable
- [ ] Performance optimization for large provider networks
- [ ] Integration with voice-based appointment requests

## Technical Details
- Implement search algorithms:
  - Date range and time preference filtering
  - Provider availability matching
  - Appointment type and duration compatibility
  - Resource and location availability
- Develop intelligent ranking:
  - Patient preference weighting
  - Provider quality and specialty matching
  - Geographic proximity optimization
  - Historical appointment success factors
- Create conflict detection:
  - Double-booking prevention
  - Resource contention checking
  - Provider schedule validation
  - Patient scheduling conflict detection
- Implement performance optimization:
  - Efficient database queries with proper indexing
  - Caching of frequently requested availability
  - Parallel availability checking
  - Result pagination and streaming

## Dependencies
- Appointment data models (054)
- Provider schedule and availability data
- Patient preference system
- Geographic and location services

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Search algorithm development: 10-12 hours
- Intelligent ranking system: 6-8 hours
- Conflict detection: 4-6 hours
- Performance optimization: 4-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Availability search returns relevant and accurate results
- Search performance meets response time requirements (<2 seconds)
- Intelligent ranking improves patient satisfaction with slot options
- Conflict detection prevents scheduling errors
- System scales with increasing provider and appointment volume
- Integration with voice interface provides natural interaction

# Create state machine navigation logic

## Description
Implement state machine navigation logic that can traverse decision trees based on user inputs and system conditions. This engine will manage conversation state, handle transitions between nodes, and maintain context throughout the call.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] State machine engine for tree navigation
- [ ] Current node tracking and state management
- [ ] Input-based transition logic
- [ ] State persistence across webhook calls
- [ ] Navigation history and backtracking capability
- [ ] Error recovery and fallback navigation
- [ ] Performance optimization for large trees
- [ ] Integration with TwiML response generation

## Technical Details
- **State Management**: Current node, collected data, navigation history
- **Transitions**: Rule evaluation, condition checking, next node selection
- **Persistence**: Session storage, database, or stateless tokens
- **Performance**: Efficient navigation algorithms
- **Recovery**: Fallback paths for invalid states
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to voice response system

## Dependencies
- Task 022 (Decision tree parser for tree structure)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: L (16-24 hours)
- State machine engine: 6-8 hours
- Navigation logic implementation: 4-6 hours
- State persistence mechanism: 3-4 hours
- Error recovery and testing: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- State machine successfully navigates through decision trees
- User inputs correctly trigger appropriate transitions
- Conversation state is maintained across multiple interactions
- Navigation history enables backtracking when needed
- Error conditions are handled with appropriate fallbacks
- Performance is acceptable for complex decision trees

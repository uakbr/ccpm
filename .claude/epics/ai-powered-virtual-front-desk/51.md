# Implement age group classification

## Description
Create an age group classification system that categorizes patients into appropriate age groups for healthcare delivery optimization, appointment scheduling, and provider specialization matching.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Age group classification algorithm based on healthcare standards
- [ ] Dynamic age calculation from date of birth
- [ ] Integration with provider specialization matching
- [ ] Age-appropriate service and appointment type filtering
- [ ] Pediatric vs adult care pathway routing
- [ ] Age group analytics and reporting

## Technical Details
- Implement age group categories:
  - Pediatric classifications (infant, toddler, child, adolescent)
  - Adult classifications (young adult, adult, senior)
  - Healthcare-specific age thresholds
  - Transition age considerations (pediatric to adult care)
- Develop classification logic:
  - Real-time age calculation from DOB
  - Age group assignment and caching
  - Age threshold configuration management
  - Historical age tracking for longitudinal care
- Create integration points:
  - Provider specialization filtering
  - Appointment type availability
  - Care pathway routing
  - Insurance coverage optimization
- Implement analytics and reporting:
  - Age group distribution analysis
  - Service utilization by age group
  - Provider capacity by age category
  - Demographic trend analysis

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Provider specialization data
- Appointment type configurations
- Healthcare age group standards

## Effort Estimate
**Size: S (4-8 hours)**
- Age classification algorithm: 2-3 hours
- Integration implementation: 2-3 hours
- Analytics and reporting: 1-2 hours
- Testing and validation: 1-2 hours

## Definition of Done
- Age group classification works accurately for all patient ages
- Integration with provider matching improves appointment relevance
- Age-appropriate services are filtered correctly
- Analytics provide insights into patient demographics
- Classification supports both current and historical age tracking
- System handles edge cases (birthdates, leap years, etc.)

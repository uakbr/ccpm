# Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

## Description
Create intelligent retry mechanism with exponential backoff strategy to handle transient failures gracefully while preventing system overload and cascade failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configurable exponential backoff algorithm
- [ ] Jitter implementation to prevent thundering herd
- [ ] Maximum retry limits and timeout handling
- [ ] Retry eligibility assessment based on error type
- [ ] Circuit breaker integration for persistent failures
- [ ] Retry metrics and success rate tracking

## Technical Details
- Exponential backoff implementation:
  - Configurable base delay and multiplier factors
  - Maximum backoff delay caps to prevent excessive delays
  - Full jitter, equal jitter, and decorrelated jitter options
  - Per-operation and per-service configuration
- Retry eligibility assessment:
  - HTTP status code-based retry decisions
  - Exception type-based retry logic
  - Business logic error vs system error differentiation
  - Rate limiting and quota exceeded handling
- Advanced retry strategies:
  - Linear backoff for time-sensitive operations
  - Fixed delay for quick recovery scenarios
  - Custom retry policies for specific integrations
  - Adaptive retry based on historical success rates
- Integration with error classification:
  - Error type-specific retry configuration
  - Severity-based retry behavior modification
  - Business impact consideration in retry decisions
  - Automatic retry policy adjustment based on patterns
- Monitoring and observability:
  - Retry attempt tracking and success rate metrics
  - Backoff delay distribution analysis
  - Retry exhaustion detection and alerting
  - Performance impact measurement of retry logic

## Dependencies
- Error classification system (084)
- Metrics and monitoring infrastructure
- Configuration management system
- Service mesh or API gateway integration

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Exponential backoff implementation: 4-6 hours
- Retry eligibility logic: 3-4 hours
- Configuration and monitoring: 2-3 hours
- Testing and validation: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Exponential backoff algorithm implemented with jitter
- Retry eligibility correctly assessed based on error types
- Maximum retry limits prevent infinite loops
- Integration with error classification functional
- Metrics provide visibility into retry behavior
- Performance impact minimized through intelligent retry logic

# Create SMS integration tests

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite for SMS integration, including unit tests, integration tests, load testing, and end-to-end validation of message delivery workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all SMS components
- [ ] Integration tests with Twilio and external services
- [ ] Load testing for high-volume message scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end message delivery validation
- [ ] Failure scenario and error handling tests
- [ ] Compliance and security testing

## Technical Details
- Unit testing coverage:
  - Template engine functionality and variable substitution
  - Message queuing and prioritization logic
  - Delivery logic and carrier routing decisions
  - Retry mechanism and backoff calculations
  - Tracking system data collection and analysis
- Integration testing scenarios:
  - Twilio API integration with authentication and webhooks
  - Template system integration with content management
  - Message queue integration with delivery processing
  - Analytics integration with tracking data collection
  - External carrier API integration and failover testing
- Load and performance testing:
  - High-volume message sending capacity testing
  - Concurrent delivery processing performance
  - Queue backlog handling under heavy load
  - Carrier rate limiting compliance testing
  - System resource utilization under peak loads
- End-to-end workflow validation:
  - Complete appointment notification delivery workflow
  - Multi-language message delivery testing
  - Scheduled message delivery validation
  - Delivery confirmation and status update testing
  - Retry workflow completion and success validation
- Failure scenario testing:
  - Network failure and timeout handling
  - Carrier API unavailability scenarios
  - Invalid phone number and delivery failure handling
  - Message queue failure and recovery testing
  - Webhook failure and retry mechanism testing
- Compliance and security testing:
  - HIPAA compliance validation for message content
  - Opt-out mechanism functionality testing
  - Data encryption and security validation
  - Audit logging accuracy and completeness testing
  - Patient data privacy protection verification

## Dependencies
- All SMS integration components (094-098)
- Test automation framework
- Load testing tools (JMeter, Artillery)
- Mock services for external API testing

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Unit and integration tests: 8-10 hours
- Load and performance testing: 4-6 hours
- End-to-end and failure scenario tests: 4-6 hours
- Compliance and security testing: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) for all SMS components
- Integration tests validate external service connectivity
- Load tests confirm high-volume messaging capability
- End-to-end tests validate complete delivery workflows
- Failure scenario tests ensure system resilience
- Compliance tests verify healthcare communication requirements

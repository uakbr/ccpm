# Configure ASR speech models

## Description
Set up and configure Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for the virtual front desk system. This includes selecting appropriate speech models, configuring model parameters, and establishing the foundation for speech input processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ASR service integration configured with appropriate speech models
- [ ] Model selection criteria documented (accuracy, latency, language support)
- [ ] Configuration parameters tuned for healthcare/appointment booking domain
- [ ] Model loading and initialization implemented
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms configured for model failures
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for model accuracy and response time

## Technical Details
- Evaluate and integrate ASR providers (Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech, AWS Transcribe, or on-premise solutions)
- Configure models for medical terminology and appointment-related vocabulary
- Set up custom vocabulary lists for common healthcare terms
- Implement model warm-up and caching strategies
- Configure audio input parameters (sample rate, encoding, channels)
- Set up model versioning and update mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Audio input infrastructure
- Cloud service accounts or on-premise ASR setup
- Healthcare terminology databases

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Research and evaluation: 4-6 hours
- Integration setup: 6-8 hours
- Configuration and tuning: 4-6 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- ASR models are successfully integrated and configured
- Model performance meets accuracy requirements (>90% for clear speech)
- Configuration is documented and version controlled
- Basic speech recognition functionality is operational
- Performance benchmarks are established and documented

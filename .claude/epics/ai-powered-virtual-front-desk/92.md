# Implement timeout handling

## Description
Create comprehensive timeout management system to handle various timeout scenarios gracefully, prevent resource leaks, and maintain system responsiveness under adverse conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configurable timeout policies for different operations
- [ ] Graceful timeout handling with appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Resource cleanup and connection management
- [ ] Timeout escalation and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Timeout monitoring and performance analysis
- [ ] Integration with retry and circuit breaker patterns

## Technical Details
- Timeout policy configuration:
  - Operation-specific timeout values (API calls, database queries)
  - Service-level timeout hierarchies with inheritance
  - Environment-specific timeout adjustments
  - Dynamic timeout adjustment based on service health
- Timeout detection and handling:
  - Proactive timeout monitoring with early warning
  - Graceful operation cancellation with cleanup
  - Resource deallocation and connection pool management
  - Thread and task timeout handling in async operations
- User experience optimization:
  - Progressive timeout feedback to users
  - Estimated wait time communication
  - Alternative action suggestions during timeouts
  - Seamless retry initiation after timeout resolution
- Escalation and fallback strategies:
  - Timeout-triggered circuit breaker activation
  - Automatic retry scheduling after timeout
  - Fallback to cached or alternative data sources
  - Manual intervention triggers for persistent timeouts
- Monitoring and analytics:
  - Timeout frequency tracking by service and operation
  - Timeout duration distribution analysis
  - Performance correlation with timeout incidents
  - Predictive timeout detection based on system metrics
- Integration with resilience patterns:
  - Timeout consideration in retry backoff calculations
  - Circuit breaker state influence on timeout policies
  - Bulkhead pattern integration for timeout isolation
  - Rate limiting coordination with timeout handling

## Dependencies
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (085)
- Circuit breaker implementation (086)
- Monitoring and metrics infrastructure
- Resource management and connection pooling

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Timeout policy and configuration: 3-4 hours
- Timeout detection and handling: 4-6 hours
- Integration with resilience patterns: 2-3 hours
- Monitoring and analytics: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Configurable timeout policies prevent system hangs
- Graceful timeout handling maintains user experience
- Resource cleanup prevents memory and connection leaks
- Integration with retry and circuit breaker patterns optimizes resilience
- Monitoring provides insights into timeout patterns
- System remains responsive under adverse network conditions

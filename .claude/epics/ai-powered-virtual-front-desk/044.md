# Implement patient data validation

## Description
Create comprehensive data validation rules and processes to ensure patient information accuracy, consistency, and compliance with healthcare data standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Field-level validation for all patient data types
- [ ] Business rule validation for healthcare-specific requirements
- [ ] Real-time validation during data entry
- [ ] Batch validation for data quality audits
- [ ] Integration with voice input error correction
- [ ] Validation reporting and data quality metrics

## Technical Details
- Implement field validation rules:
  - Format validation (phone numbers, emails, SSN, dates)
  - Range validation (age limits, date ranges)
  - Pattern validation (ZIP codes, insurance IDs)
  - Required field enforcement
- Develop business rule validation:
  - Age consistency with date of birth
  - Insurance eligibility verification
  - Address standardization and validation
  - Provider-patient relationship constraints
- Create voice-specific validation:
  - Phonetic validation for transcribed names
  - Date parsing with multiple format support
  - Number sequence validation (SSN, phone)
  - Spelling confirmation for critical fields
- Implement validation reporting:
  - Data quality dashboards
  - Validation failure analytics
  - Trend analysis for common errors
  - Automated data cleansing suggestions

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- External validation services (address, insurance)
- Data quality frameworks
- Voice transcription error patterns

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- Validation rule implementation: 4-6 hours
- Voice-specific validation: 3-4 hours
- Integration and testing: 2-3 hours
- Reporting and analytics: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- All patient data fields have appropriate validation rules
- Voice input validation handles transcription errors effectively
- Real-time validation prevents invalid data entry
- Batch validation identifies and reports data quality issues
- Validation rules are configurable and maintainable
- Data quality metrics show measurable improvement

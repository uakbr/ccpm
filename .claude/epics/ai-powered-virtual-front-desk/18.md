# Implement call queue management

## Description
Develop a call queue management system to handle multiple simultaneous callers when staff members are unavailable or when call volume exceeds capacity. This includes queue position announcements, estimated wait times, and callback options.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Call queue creation and management
- [ ] Queue position and wait time announcements
- [ ] Hold music or periodic updates for waiting callers
- [ ] Callback request functionality
- [ ] Queue overflow handling (voicemail, alternate routing)
- [ ] Staff notification system for queued calls
- [ ] Queue analytics and performance monitoring
- [ ] Priority queuing for urgent calls

## Technical Details
- **Queue Management**: FIFO with priority override options
- **Announcements**: Dynamic position and wait time updates
- **Hold Experience**: Music, messages, or periodic updates
- **Callbacks**: Caller-requested callback scheduling
- **Overflow**: Automatic routing to voicemail or alternatives
- **Monitoring**: Queue length, wait times, abandonment rates

## Dependencies
- Task 014 (Call logging for queue metrics)
- Task 016 (Call transfer for queue-to-staff routing)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: L (16-24 hours)
- Queue management system: 6-8 hours
- Hold experience and announcements: 4-6 hours
- Callback functionality: 3-4 hours
- Analytics and monitoring: 3-6 hours

## Definition of Done
- Call queue manages multiple simultaneous callers
- Callers receive accurate position and wait time information
- Hold experience keeps callers engaged and informed
- Callback functionality provides alternative to waiting
- Queue overflow scenarios are handled appropriately
- Staff receive appropriate notifications about queued calls

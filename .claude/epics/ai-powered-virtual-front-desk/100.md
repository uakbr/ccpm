# Configure Datadog integration

## Description
Set up comprehensive Datadog monitoring integration for the virtual front desk system, including infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, and log aggregation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Datadog agent deployment across all infrastructure
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- [ ] Log aggregation and parsing configuration
- [ ] Custom metrics and dashboards setup
- [ ] Alert rules and notification channels
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant monitoring configuration

## Technical Details
- Infrastructure monitoring setup:
  - Datadog agent installation on all servers and containers
  - Infrastructure metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, network)
  - Container monitoring with Docker and Kubernetes integration
  - Cloud provider integration (AWS/Azure/GCP) for resource monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM):
  - APM agent integration with application code
  - Distributed tracing for microservices architecture
  - Database query performance monitoring
  - External service dependency tracking
- Log management configuration:
  - Log forwarding from all application components
  - Structured log parsing and indexing
  - Log correlation with traces and metrics
  - Sensitive data masking and HIPAA compliance
- Custom metrics and instrumentation:
  - Business metrics (appointment bookings, call success rates)
  - Voice interaction quality metrics (speech recognition accuracy)
  - Patient experience metrics (call duration, satisfaction scores)
  - System health metrics (queue depths, response times)
- Dashboard and visualization:
  - Executive dashboard with key business metrics
  - Operational dashboard for support teams
  - System health dashboard for infrastructure teams
  - Real-time monitoring dashboard for critical alerts
- Alerting and notification setup:
  - Threshold-based alerts for critical metrics
  - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
  - Multi-channel notification (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
  - Alert escalation and acknowledgment workflows

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure and application deployment
- Network security and firewall configuration
- HIPAA compliance and security requirements
- Notification systems (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Infrastructure and APM setup: 6-8 hours
- Log management configuration: 4-6 hours
- Custom metrics and dashboards: 3-4 hours
- Alerting and notification setup: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Datadog monitors all infrastructure components comprehensively
- APM provides detailed application performance insights
- Log aggregation captures and analyzes all system logs
- Custom dashboards provide business and operational insights
- Alert system notifies appropriate teams of issues
- HIPAA compliance requirements satisfied for monitoring data

# Create error classification system

## Description
Design and implement comprehensive error classification system to categorize, prioritize, and route different types of errors for appropriate handling and resolution strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error taxonomy with severity levels and categories
- [ ] Automatic error classification and tagging
- [ ] Error routing rules based on classification
- [ ] Error pattern recognition and clustering
- [ ] Business impact assessment for errors
- [ ] Integration with existing logging systems

## Technical Details
- Error classification taxonomy:
  - Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Error categories (System, Business Logic, Integration, User, Data)
  - Error types (Transient, Permanent, Configuration, Network)
  - Impact assessment (Patient Safety, Data Integrity, Service Availability)
- Automatic classification engine:
  - Machine learning-based error pattern recognition
  - Rule-based classification for known error types
  - Context-aware classification using call flow information
  - Real-time classification with immediate routing
- Error routing and escalation:
  - Severity-based routing to appropriate support teams
  - Business hour vs after-hour routing rules
  - Provider-specific escalation paths
  - Integration with existing ticketing systems
- Pattern recognition and analytics:
  - Error clustering and trend identification
  - Root cause analysis suggestion system
  - Predictive error detection based on patterns
  - Performance impact correlation analysis
- Business impact assessment:
  - Patient experience impact scoring
  - Revenue impact calculation for booking failures
  - Provider productivity impact measurement
  - Compliance risk assessment for data errors

## Dependencies
- Existing logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Machine learning platform
- Ticketing and support systems
- Business metrics and KPI systems

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Classification taxonomy design: 4-6 hours
- Automatic classification engine: 6-8 hours
- Routing and escalation logic: 3-4 hours
- Pattern recognition system: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Complete error classification taxonomy implemented
- Automatic classification accurately categorizes errors
- Error routing directs issues to appropriate teams
- Pattern recognition identifies trends and anomalies
- Business impact assessment provides actionable insights
- System integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure

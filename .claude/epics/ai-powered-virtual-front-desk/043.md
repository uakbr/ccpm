# Create duplicate patient detection

## Description
Implement intelligent duplicate patient detection to prevent creation of duplicate records and identify potential matches during patient registration and search operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-field matching algorithm for duplicate detection
- [ ] Confidence scoring for potential duplicates
- [ ] Manual review workflow for uncertain matches
- [ ] Automatic merging for high-confidence duplicates
- [ ] Integration with patient registration and search flows
- [ ] Reporting and analytics for duplicate patterns

## Technical Details
- Develop matching algorithms:
  - Exact match detection for unique identifiers
  - Fuzzy matching for names with variations
  - Demographic data similarity scoring
  - Contact information cross-referencing
  - Historical appointment pattern analysis
- Implement confidence scoring:
  - Weighted scoring based on field importance
  - Threshold-based classification (definite, probable, possible)
  - Machine learning models for pattern recognition
  - False positive minimization strategies
- Create duplicate resolution workflow:
  - Automatic flagging of potential duplicates
  - Manual review interface for uncertain cases
  - Guided merging process with data preservation
  - Conflict resolution for differing information
- Develop monitoring and analytics:
  - Duplicate detection performance metrics
  - Pattern analysis for system improvement
  - Regular audits of duplicate resolution decisions

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient search functionality (040)
- Fuzzy matching libraries
- Data analytics infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Matching algorithm development: 8-10 hours
- Confidence scoring system: 4-6 hours
- Resolution workflow: 4-6 hours
- Analytics and monitoring: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Duplicate detection accurately identifies potential matches
- Confidence scoring helps prioritize manual review cases
- Automatic merging works for high-confidence duplicates
- Manual review workflow is efficient and user-friendly
- System prevents most duplicate patient creation
- Analytics provide insights for continuous improvement

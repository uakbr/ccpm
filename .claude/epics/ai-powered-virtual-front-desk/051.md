# Create patient history retrieval

## Description
Implement efficient patient history retrieval system that provides relevant historical information during voice interactions to improve appointment scheduling and care continuity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive patient history data retrieval
- [ ] Configurable history depth and scope
- [ ] Performance-optimized history queries
- [ ] Relevant history filtering for appointment context
- [ ] Privacy-compliant history access controls
- [ ] Integration with appointment scheduling workflow

## Technical Details
- Implement history retrieval system:
  - Appointment history with outcomes
  - Provider interaction history
  - Service utilization patterns
  - Cancellation and no-show history
  - Communication preference history
- Develop relevance filtering:
  - Recent appointment prioritization
  - Provider-specific history
  - Service type relevance
  - Seasonal pattern recognition
- Create performance optimization:
  - Efficient history queries with proper indexing
  - Cached frequent history requests
  - Paginated history retrieval
  - Summary statistics for quick access
- Implement privacy and access controls:
  - Role-based history access
  - Minimum necessary information principle
  - History access logging
  - Sensitive information filtering

## Dependencies
- Patient data models (039)
- Patient record caching (047)
- Appointment history data
- Access control frameworks

## Effort Estimate
**Size: M (8-16 hours)**
- History retrieval system: 4-6 hours
- Performance optimization: 2-3 hours
- Privacy controls: 2-3 hours
- Integration and testing: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Patient history retrieval is fast and comprehensive
- Relevant history information improves appointment scheduling
- Privacy controls limit access to appropriate information
- Performance meets response time requirements
- History data enhances voice interaction context
- System scales with growing patient history volume

## Description
Implement comprehensive data encryption at rest for all sensitive data including PHI, PII, and system configurations using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption for database storage
- [ ] Encrypt all file system storage containing sensitive data
- [ ] Implement transparent data encryption (TDE) for databases
- [ ] Create secure key management system with rotation
- [ ] Encrypt backup data and archives

## Technical Details
- Use AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for key management
- Implement database-level encryption for PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Configure filesystem encryption for temporary files and logs
- Set up automated key rotation policies
- Implement encryption performance monitoring

## Dependencies
- Cloud infrastructure must be provisioned
- Database systems must be deployed

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest with AES-256
- Key management system operational with rotation
- Encryption performance meets requirements
- Backup encryption validated and tested
- Documentation updated with encryption procedures

# Implement decision tree parser

## Description
Develop a decision tree parser that can load, validate, and prepare JSON-defined decision trees for execution. The parser must handle schema validation, node relationship verification, and optimization for runtime performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JSON decision tree loading and parsing
- [ ] Schema validation against defined schema
- [ ] Node relationship and dependency validation
- [ ] Decision tree optimization for runtime execution
- [ ] Error reporting for malformed trees
- [ ] Caching mechanism for parsed trees
- [ ] Tree preprocessing for performance
- [ ] Integration with tree execution engine

## Technical Details
- **Parsing**: JSON deserialization with validation
- **Validation**: Schema compliance, node references, cycles
- **Optimization**: Tree indexing, path analysis
- **Caching**: In-memory caching with invalidation
- **Performance**: Fast lookup and navigation structures
- **Integration**: Clean API for execution engine consumption

## Dependencies
- Task 021 (JSON schema for validation)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Parser implementation: 4-6 hours
- Validation logic: 3-4 hours
- Optimization and caching: 2-3 hours
- Testing and error handling: 3-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Parser successfully loads and validates decision trees
- Schema validation catches malformed tree definitions
- Node relationships are verified for correctness
- Parsed trees are optimized for runtime performance
- Error messages provide clear guidance for tree authors
- Caching improves performance for repeated tree access

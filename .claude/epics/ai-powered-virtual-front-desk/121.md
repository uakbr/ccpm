## Description
Implement comprehensive load testing framework to validate system performance under various load conditions and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create load test scenarios for peak usage patterns
- [ ] Test system performance with concurrent speech recognition requests
- [ ] Validate database performance under heavy read/write loads
- [ ] Test API rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- [ ] Implement stress testing for system breaking points

## Technical Details
- Use k6, JMeter, or Artillery for load testing
- Create realistic user behavior models
- Implement gradual load ramp-up scenarios
- Monitor system metrics during load tests (CPU, memory, database)
- Create load test execution automation

## Dependencies
- Integration test suite must be operational
- Performance monitoring tools required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Load testing framework operational with realistic scenarios
- Performance baselines established for all critical paths
- System breaking points identified and documented
- Load test results integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Performance degradation alerts configured

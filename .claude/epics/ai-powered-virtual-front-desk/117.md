## Description
Implement comprehensive security testing suite including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, security code review, and compliance testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Create security unit tests for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Establish penetration testing procedures
- [ ] Implement security code analysis tools
- [ ] Create compliance testing frameworks

## Technical Details
- Deploy SAST/DAST tools (SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Veracode)
- Create security test cases for API endpoints
- Implement infrastructure vulnerability scanning
- Set up dependency vulnerability checking
- Configure security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies
- Access control mechanisms must be implemented
- Secure credential storage system required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Automated security scanning operational in CI/CD
- Security test suite covers all critical paths
- Penetration testing procedures documented
- Security findings tracked and remediated
- Security testing integrated into development workflow

# Create decision tree validator

## Description
Develop a comprehensive validation system for decision trees to ensure they are logically sound, complete, and will function correctly in production. This includes structural validation, logical consistency checks, and runtime simulation capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Schema compliance validation
- [ ] Node connectivity and reachability analysis
- [ ] Dead end and infinite loop detection
- [ ] Condition logic validation and testing
- [ ] Slot collection completeness verification
- [ ] Integration point validation
- [ ] Performance impact analysis
- [ ] Automated testing framework for tree validation

## Technical Details
- **Schema**: JSON schema validation for structure
- **Graph Analysis**: Connectivity, reachability, cycle detection
- **Logic Validation**: Condition syntax, boolean logic correctness
- **Completeness**: All paths lead to valid outcomes
- **Simulation**: Test tree execution with sample inputs
- **Performance**: Complexity analysis, optimization suggestions

## Dependencies
- Task 021 (JSON schema for structure validation)
- Task 022 (Tree parser for validation processing)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Validation framework development: 4-6 hours
- Graph analysis algorithms: 3-4 hours
- Logic and completeness checking: 2-3 hours
- Testing and simulation tools: 3-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- Validator catches structural and logical tree problems
- Dead ends and infinite loops are detected and reported
- Condition logic is verified for correctness
- All conversation paths are validated for completeness
- Performance issues are identified and reported
- Validation integrates into tree development workflow

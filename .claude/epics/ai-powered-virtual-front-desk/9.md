# Set up testing frameworks

## Description
Configure comprehensive testing frameworks for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing of the virtual front desk system. This includes test runners, mocking capabilities, and automated test execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit testing framework configured (Jest, pytest, etc.)
- [ ] Integration testing setup for API endpoints
- [ ] Mock services configured for external dependencies (Twilio, NexHealth)
- [ ] Test data management and fixtures created
- [ ] Code coverage reporting implemented
- [ ] End-to-end testing framework for call flows
- [ ] Performance testing capability established
- [ ] Test execution integrated into CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details
- **Unit Tests**: Jest (Node.js) or pytest (Python)
- **Integration**: Supertest, requests, or similar
- **Mocking**: Sinon.js, unittest.mock, or service mocking
- **E2E**: Puppeteer, Playwright, or call simulation tools
- **Coverage**: Istanbul, coverage.py, or built-in tools
- **Performance**: Artillery, k6, or load testing framework

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (CI/CD pipeline for test automation)
- Task 004 (Development environment for test execution)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Framework setup and configuration: 4-6 hours
- Mock service development: 3-4 hours
- Test fixture and data creation: 2-3 hours
- CI/CD integration: 2-3 hours

## Definition of Done
- All testing frameworks are configured and functional
- Mock services accurately simulate external dependencies
- Code coverage reporting provides meaningful metrics
- Tests execute automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- End-to-end tests can simulate complete call scenarios
- Testing documentation guides developers on best practices

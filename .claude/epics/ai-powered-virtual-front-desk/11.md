# Set up voice webhook endpoints

## Description
Create and configure webhook endpoints that handle incoming voice calls from Twilio. These endpoints will serve as the entry points for the virtual front desk system and must reliably process TwiML responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Voice webhook endpoint created and deployed
- [ ] TwiML response handling implemented
- [ ] Webhook authentication and validation configured
- [ ] Error handling and fallback responses implemented
- [ ] Request logging and monitoring set up
- [ ] Webhook endpoint health checks configured
- [ ] Load balancing and scaling capability established
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption enforced for all webhook traffic

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Express.js, FastAPI, or similar web framework
- **Authentication**: Twilio signature validation
- **Response Format**: Valid TwiML XML responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback prompts
- **Logging**: Structured logging for call tracking
- **Security**: HTTPS-only, request validation, rate limiting

## Dependencies
- Task 004 (Development environment for endpoint development)
- Task 009 (Phone numbers to configure webhook URLs)

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: M (8-16 hours)
- Endpoint development: 4-6 hours
- Authentication and security: 3-4 hours
- Error handling and testing: 3-4 hours
- Deployment and monitoring: 2-2 hours

## Definition of Done
- Webhook endpoints respond correctly to Twilio voice calls
- TwiML responses are valid and functional
- Authentication prevents unauthorized access
- Error conditions are handled gracefully
- All requests are logged for debugging and monitoring
- Endpoints are deployed and accessible via HTTPS

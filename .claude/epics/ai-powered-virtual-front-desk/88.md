# Implement graceful degradation

## Description
Create graceful degradation system that maintains core functionality and user experience when non-critical services fail or performance degrades.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service dependency mapping and criticality classification
- [ ] Feature toggle system for non-critical functionality
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for degraded services
- [ ] User experience preservation during degradation
- [ ] Automatic degradation triggering based on health metrics
- [ ] Manual degradation control for planned maintenance

## Technical Details
- Service dependency analysis:
  - Critical path identification for core appointment booking
  - Non-critical feature classification (analytics, recommendations)
  - Service interdependency mapping and impact analysis
  - Degradation cascade prevention strategies
- Feature toggle implementation:
  - Dynamic feature flags for non-critical functionality
  - Real-time toggle activation based on service health
  - User-level and provider-level feature control
  - A/B testing integration for degradation scenarios
- Fallback mechanism design:
  - Cached data utilization for offline functionality
  - Simplified workflow paths during degradation
  - Alternative service provider integration
  - Static content serving for informational features
- User experience optimization:
  - Progressive disclosure of available functionality
  - Clear communication about degraded capabilities
  - Alternative action suggestions for disabled features
  - Seamless restoration when services recover
- Automatic degradation triggers:
  - Circuit breaker state integration
  - Performance threshold monitoring
  - Error rate-based degradation activation
  - Resource utilization-based degradation decisions
- Monitoring and observability:
  - Degradation state tracking and visualization
  - Impact measurement on user experience metrics
  - Recovery time monitoring and optimization
  - Degradation effectiveness analysis

## Dependencies
- Circuit breaker implementation (086)
- Feature flag management system
- Service health monitoring
- User experience analytics

## Effort Estimate
**Size: XL (24+ hours)**
- Service dependency mapping: 6-8 hours
- Feature toggle system: 6-8 hours
- Fallback mechanisms: 6-8 hours
- Monitoring and UX optimization: 6-8 hours

## Definition of Done
- Core functionality remains available during service degradation
- Non-critical features gracefully disabled when necessary
- Fallback mechanisms provide acceptable user experience
- Automatic degradation triggers respond appropriately
- Manual control allows planned degradation scenarios
- Monitoring provides insights into degradation effectiveness

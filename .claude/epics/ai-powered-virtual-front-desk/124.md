## Description
Create comprehensive API contract tests to ensure API compatibility, validate request/response schemas, and prevent breaking changes in service interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement contract testing for all API endpoints
- [ ] Validate request and response schema compliance
- [ ] Test API versioning and backward compatibility
- [ ] Create consumer-driven contract tests
- [ ] Implement breaking change detection

## Technical Details
- Use Pact or similar contract testing framework
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all APIs
- Implement schema validation using JSON Schema
- Set up contract test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Create contract test documentation and maintenance procedures

## Dependencies
- Unit test framework must be established
- API documentation and schemas required

## Effort Estimate
M (8-16 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Contract tests operational for all API endpoints
- API schemas validated against implementation
- Breaking change detection prevents incompatible deployments
- Consumer contracts validated before deployment
- Contract test results integrated into quality gates

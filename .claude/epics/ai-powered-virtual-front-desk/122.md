## Description
Create comprehensive performance benchmarks and SLA definitions for all system components including response times, throughput, and resource utilization metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define performance SLAs for all critical user interactions
- [ ] Create benchmarks for speech recognition processing time
- [ ] Establish database query performance baselines
- [ ] Define API response time targets and thresholds
- [ ] Create performance regression detection mechanisms

## Technical Details
- Implement continuous performance monitoring
- Create performance test suites that run on every deployment
- Set up performance alerting when benchmarks are exceeded
- Document performance characteristics for capacity planning
- Implement performance budgets for feature development

## Dependencies
- Load testing framework must be operational
- Application performance monitoring tools required

## Effort Estimate
S (4-8 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Performance benchmarks documented for all critical paths
- SLA targets defined and approved by stakeholders
- Performance regression detection operational
- Capacity planning models created based on benchmarks
- Performance monitoring dashboards available to operations team

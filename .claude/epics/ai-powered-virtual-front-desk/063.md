# Implement scheduling conflict detection

## Description
Develop intelligent scheduling conflict detection that identifies and prevents various types of appointment conflicts including double-booking, resource contention, and scheduling rule violations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time conflict detection during booking
- [ ] Multiple conflict type identification and handling
- [ ] Automatic conflict resolution suggestions
- [ ] Conflict prevention through proactive checking
- [ ] Integration with booking workflow and user interface
- [ ] Conflict analytics and pattern recognition

## Technical Details
- Implement conflict detection types:
  - Provider double-booking detection
  - Patient scheduling conflicts
  - Resource and room availability conflicts
  - Equipment and facility scheduling conflicts
- Develop real-time checking:
  - Immediate conflict validation during slot selection
  - Concurrent booking protection with locking
  - Cross-system conflict detection
  - Temporal conflict analysis (appointment buffers)
- Create resolution strategies:
  - Alternative slot suggestion algorithms
  - Automatic conflict resolution where possible
  - Escalation workflows for complex conflicts
  - User-guided conflict resolution options
- Implement proactive prevention:
  - Predictive conflict analysis
  - Schedule optimization recommendations
  - Capacity planning and resource allocation
  - Conflict pattern recognition and prevention

## Dependencies
- Slot availability search (055)
- Appointment booking API (059)
- Resource management systems
- Real-time scheduling coordination

## Effort Estimate
**Size: L (16-24 hours)**
- Conflict detection algorithms: 8-10 hours
- Resolution strategy implementation: 4-6 hours
- Real-time integration: 3-4 hours
- Analytics and optimization: 3-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- Conflict detection prevents all major types of scheduling conflicts
- Real-time checking provides immediate feedback during booking
- Automatic resolution reduces manual intervention requirements
- System scales effectively with increasing appointment volume
- Conflict analytics provide insights for scheduling optimization
- Integration with voice interface provides clear conflict explanation

## Description
Create comprehensive test coverage reporting system to track code coverage, identify untested code paths, and ensure adequate test coverage across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement code coverage collection for all test types
- [ ] Create coverage reporting dashboard with trends
- [ ] Establish coverage thresholds and quality gates
- [ ] Implement coverage diff reporting for code changes
- [ ] Create coverage badges and metrics for visibility

## Technical Details
- Use Istanbul, JaCoCo, or coverage.py for coverage collection
- Integrate coverage reporting with CI/CD pipeline
- Create coverage trend analysis and historical tracking
- Implement branch and line coverage measurement
- Set up coverage report publishing and archival

## Dependencies
- Test automation pipeline must be operational
- Code coverage tools must be configured

## Effort Estimate
S (4-8 hours)

## Definition of Done
- Code coverage reporting operational for all code components
- Coverage thresholds enforced in quality gates
- Coverage trends tracked and visualized
- Coverage reports accessible to development team
- Low coverage areas identified and prioritized for testing

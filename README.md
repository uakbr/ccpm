## Why This Matters

Every team struggles with the same problems:
- **Context evaporates** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specs
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end

This system solves all of that.

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Development | Claude Code PM System |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Context lost between sessions | **Persistent context** across all work |
| Serial task execution | **Parallel agents** on independent tasks |
| "Vibe coding" from memory | **Spec-driven** with full traceability |
| Progress hidden in branches | **Transparent audit trail** in GitHub |
| Manual task coordination | **Intelligent prioritization** with `/pm:next` |

## Why GitHub Issues as the Database?

Most Claude Code workflows operate in isolation – a single developer working with AI in their local environment. This creates a fundamental problem: **AI-assisted development becomes a silo**.

By using GitHub Issues as our database, we unlock something powerful:

### 🤝 **True Team Collaboration**
- Multiple Claude instances can work on the same project simultaneously
- Human developers see AI progress in real-time through issue comments
- Team members can jump in anywhere – the context is always visible
- Managers get transparency without interrupting flow

### 🔄 **Seamless Human-AI Handoffs**
- AI can start a task, human can finish it (or vice versa)
- Progress updates are visible to everyone, not trapped in chat logs
- Code reviews happen naturally through PR comments
- No "what did the AI do?" meetings

### 📈 **Scalable Beyond Solo Work**
- Add team members without onboarding friction
- Multiple AI agents working in parallel on different issues
- Distributed teams stay synchronized automatically
- Works with existing GitHub workflows and tools

### 🎯 **Single Source of Truth**
- No separate databases or project management tools
- Issue state is the project state
- Comments are the audit trail
- Labels provide organization

This isn't just a project management system – it's a **collaboration protocol** that lets humans and AI agents work together at scale, using infrastructure your team already trusts.

## Core Philosophy: No Vibe Coding

> **Every line of code must trace back to a specification.**

We follow a strict 5-phase discipline:

1. **🧠 Brainstorm** - Think deeper than comfortable
2. **📝 Document** - Write specs that leave nothing to interpretation
3. **📐 Plan** - Architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **⚡ Execute** - Build exactly what was specified
5. **📊 Track** - Maintain transparent progress at every step

No shortcuts. No assumptions. No regrets.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Product Planning Phase

```bash
/pm:prd-new feature-name
```
Launches comprehensive brainstorming to create a Product Requirements Document capturing vision, user stories, success criteria, and constraints.

**Output:** `.claude/prds/feature-name.md`

### 2. Implementation Planning Phase

```bash
/pm:prd-parse feature-name
```
Transforms PRD into a technical implementation plan with architectural decisions, technical approach, and dependency mapping.

**Output:** `.claude/epics/feature-name/epic.md`

### 3. Task Decomposition Phase

```bash
/pm:epic-decompose feature-name
```
Breaks epic into concrete, actionable tasks with acceptance criteria, effort estimates, and parallelization flags.

**Output:** `.claude/epics/feature-name/[task].md`

### 4. GitHub Synchronization

```bash
/pm:epic-sync feature-name
# Or for confident workflows:
/pm:epic-oneshot feature-name
```
Pushes epic and tasks to GitHub as issues with appropriate labels and relationships.

### 5. Execution Phase

```bash
/pm:issue-start 1234  # Launch specialized agent
/pm:issue-sync 1234   # Push progress updates
/pm:next             # Get next priority task
```
Specialized agents implement tasks while maintaining progress updates and an audit trail.

## The Parallel Execution System

### Issues Aren't Atomic

Traditional thinking: One issue = One developer = One task

**Reality: One issue = Multiple parallel work streams**

A single "Implement user authentication" issue isn't one task. It's...

- **Agent 1**: Database tables and migrations
- **Agent 2**: Service layer and business logic
- **Agent 3**: API endpoints and middleware
- **Agent 4**: UI components and forms
- **Agent 5**: Test suites and documentation

All running **simultaneously** in the same worktree.

### The Math of Velocity

**Traditional Approach:**
- Epic with 3 issues
- Sequential execution

**This System:**
- Same epic with 3 issues
- Each issue splits into ~4 parallel streams
- **12 agents working simultaneously**

We're not assigning agents to issues. We're **leveraging multiple agents** to ship faster.

### Context Optimization

**Traditional single-thread approach:**
- Main conversation carries ALL the implementation details
- Context window fills with database schemas, API code, UI components
- Eventually hits context limits and loses coherence

**Parallel agent approach:**
- Main thread stays clean and strategic
- Each agent handles its own context in isolation
- Implementation details never pollute the main conversation
- Main thread maintains oversight without drowning in code

Your main conversation becomes the conductor, not the orchestra.

### GitHub vs Local: Perfect Separation

**What GitHub Sees:**
- Clean, simple issues
- Progress updates
- Completion status

**What Actually Happens Locally:**
- Issue #1234 explodes into 5 parallel agents
- Agents coordinate through Git commits
- Complex orchestration hidden from view

GitHub doesn't need to know HOW the work got done – just that it IS done.

### The Command Flow

```bash
# Analyze what can be parallelized
/pm:issue-analyze 1234

# Launch the swarm
/pm:epic-start memory-system

# Watch the magic
# 12 agents working across 3 issues
# All in: ../epic-memory-system/

# One clean merge when done
/pm:epic-merge memory-system
```

## Key Features & Benefits

### 🧠 **Context Preservation**
Never lose project state again. Each epic maintains its own context, agents read from `.claude/context/`, and updates locally before syncing.

### ⚡ **Parallel Execution**
Ship faster with multiple agents working simultaneously. Tasks marked `parallel: true` enable conflict-free concurrent development.

### 🔗 **GitHub Native**
Works with tools your team already uses. Issues are the source of truth, comments provide history, and there is no dependency on the Projects API.

### 🤖 **Agent Specialization**
Right tool for every job. Different agents for UI, API, and database work. Each reads requirements and posts updates automatically.

### 📊 **Full Traceability**
Every decision is documented. PRD → Epic → Task → Issue → Code → Commit. Complete audit trail from idea to production.

### 🚀 **Developer Productivity**
Focus on building, not managing. Intelligent prioritization, automatic context loading, and incremental sync when ready.

## Get Started Now

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Clone this repository into your project**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project/
   git clone https://github.com/ranaroussi/ccpm.git .
   cd ccpm/
   ```

   > If you already have a `.claude` directory, clone this repository to a different directory and copy the contents of the cloned `.claude` directory to your project's `.claude` directory.

2. **Add to `.gitignore`**:
   ```
   .claude/epics/
   ```
   > This directory is intended for the local workspace. It is not intended to be pushed to GitHub.

3. **Install prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure gh CLI is installed and authenticated
   gh auth status
   ```

4. **Create `CLAUDE.md`** with your repository information
   ```bash
   /init include rules from .claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```
   > If you already have a `CLAUDE.md` file, run: `/re-init` to update it with important rules from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

5. **Prime the system**:
   ```bash
   /context:create
   ```



### Start Your First Feature

```bash
/pm:prd-new your-feature-name
```

Watch as structured planning transforms into shipped code.

## Local vs Remote

| Operation | Local | GitHub |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| PRD Creation | ✓ | |
| Implementation Planning | ✓ | |
| Task Breakdown | ✓ | ✓ (sync) |
| Execution | ✓ | |
| Status Updates | ✓ | ✓ (sync) |
| Final Deliverables | | ✓ |

## Notes

- Intentionally avoids GitHub Projects API complexity
- Issues use labels for organization (e.g., `epic:feature`, `task:feature`)
- All commands operate on local files first for speed
- Synchronization with GitHub is explicit and controlled
- GitHub Projects can be added separately for visualization
